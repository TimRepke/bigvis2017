"Mark:  Just wanted you to be aware per our request, Bill Paxon sent the  attached Letter to the Editor of the Wall Street Journal on behalf of AAE.   We hope his political standing will enhance the chances for the paper to  print it.   August 9, 2000  Wall Street Journal 200 Liberty Street New York, NY 10281  Dear Editor:  John Fialka and Rebecca Smith are to be congratulated for the first piece of journalism I am aware of that has attempted to explain what is really behind the energy problems in the overheated West (Deregulation Leaves Electricity Market Ripe for Manipulation by Power Firms, August 4). As this piece makes clear, these crises of capacity and delivery of electricity around the nation are doomed to continue for a simple reason:  electricity is a new game, still being played under old rules. It is becoming a competitive market, but the old rules written for a government-sanctioned monopoly market  haven't been updated.  As a result, some old-line utilities are exploiting and even contributing to the crises with behavior that is not controlled by the old rules. As the story details, utilities can drive prices up, exacerbate the energy shortage by withholding electricity from the grid, or impede the free flow of electricity across lines they control.  It's gamesmanship, very profitable and not illegal, but definitely not in the public interest.  There is a very simple fix to the problem.  Write new rules.  Some old laws need to be repealed. Some new oversight over this interstate commodity has to be given the Federal government so that the general welfare gains some control over local profiteering.  There are bills in Congress that make these fixes. But a few powerful utilities block their passage. As long as this blockade remains in effect, the industry cannot move forward to modernize itself, build new generating capacity, and streamline the way electricity moves from region to region.  Some day, Congress will pass the needed legislation. Why not now?   Sincerely,     Bill Paxon National Chairman Americans for Affordable Electricity",9 Aug,cynthia.sandherr@enron.com,eval/kean-s_calendar_untitled_973.txt.ann,KEAN-S,04:06:00,mark.palmer@enron.com
"State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected  Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests  Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, March 16, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying  electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential  document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle.  State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging  $49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers  figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests.  The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources,  which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of  lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom  Hannigan.  To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much  California is spending on power purchases.  Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed,  it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw  it.  ""I don't think it was a surprise,"" said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R-  Redding.  Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity,  analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could  jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term.  For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education  programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst  warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in  Davis' proposed budget.  Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit  rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the  utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a  credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans  to rise.  ""This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect,"" said Jean Ross, executive  director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that  tracks state spending. ""Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the  energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look  like in the future.""  The biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent  nearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour. The smallest  day was March 10 when the state buyers spent $40 million, or $219 per  megawatt hour.  Michael Worm, an analyst with the investment firm Gerald Klauer Mattison &  Co., said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices.  ""That's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time,"" he  said. ""Of course, they are dramatically higher than they used to be.""  The governor's office has refused to release information on how much the  state has spent, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. Maviglio said if  generators found out how much the state spent the day before, they could  force up the price the next day.  But Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the public had a right  to know how its money way being spent.  ""People need to know exactly what it is costing to keep the lights on,"" he  said. ""We want to know the whole story -- not just pieces.""  Strickland, along with media organizations including The Chronicle, have  filed public records act requests to obtain information on how much the state  has spent, along with the details of long-term power contracts signed by  Davis.  The original bill that authorized the state to purchase power appropriated  only $500 million, but allowed the governor to use up to $10 billion if  needed for power purchases by notifying lawmakers. The governor's office has  sent five letters since Feb. 5 to lawmakers notifying them that additional  money was needed.  Based on these letters, which in total have requested an additional $2.5  billion, the news media and lawmakers estimated that the state was spending  $43 million a day -- $6 million less than the actual costs shown on the Water  Resources document.  Since the state began purchasing electricity, the health of its budget has  become dependent on a variety of things to come, making it as fragile as a  house of cards.  The money spent on power is taken from the state's general fund and is  supposed to be returned through the issuance of state bonds. The bonds will  be paid for with a portion of the rates that utility customers pay every  month.  -  Tell Us What You Think Can you save 20 percent on your energy usage? Gov.

It was handed to a group of  lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom  Hannigan.  To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much  California is spending on power purchases.  Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed,  it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw  it.  ""I don't think it was a surprise,"" said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R-  Redding.  Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity,  analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could  jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term.  For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education  programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst  warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in  Davis' proposed budget.  Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit  rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the  utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a  credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans  to rise.  ""This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect,"" said Jean Ross, executive  director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that  tracks state spending. ""Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the  energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look  like in the future.""  The biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent  nearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour. The smallest  day was March 10 when the state buyers spent $40 million, or $219 per  megawatt hour.  Michael Worm, an analyst with the investment firm Gerald Klauer Mattison &  Co., said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices.  ""That's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time,"" he  said. ""Of course, they are dramatically higher than they used to be.""  The governor's office has refused to release information on how much the  state has spent, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman.

""People need to know exactly what it is costing to keep the lights on,"" he  said. ""We want to know the whole story -- not just pieces.""  Strickland, along with media organizations including The Chronicle, have  filed public records act requests to obtain information on how much the state  has spent, along with the details of long-term power contracts signed by  Davis.  The original bill that authorized the state to purchase power appropriated  only $500 million, but allowed the governor to use up to $10 billion if  needed for power purchases by notifying lawmakers. The governor's office has  sent five letters since Feb. 5 to lawmakers notifying them that additional  money was needed.  Based on these letters, which in total have requested an additional $2.5  billion, the news media and lawmakers estimated that the state was spending  $43 million a day -- $6 million less than the actual costs shown on the Water  Resources document.  Since the state began purchasing electricity, the health of its budget has  become dependent on a variety of things to come, making it as fragile as a  house of cards.

"State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected  Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests  Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, March 16, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying  electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential  document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle.  State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging  $49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers  figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests.  The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources,  which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of  lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom  Hannigan.  To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much  California is spending on power purchases.  Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed,  it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw  it.  ""I don't think it was a surprise,"" said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R-  Redding.  Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity,  analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could  jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term.  For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education  programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst  warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in  Davis' proposed budget.  Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit  rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the  utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a  credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans  to rise.  ""This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect,"" said Jean Ross, executive  director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that  tracks state spending. ""Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the  energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look  like in the future.""  The biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent  nearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour. The smallest  day was March 10 when the state buyers spent $40 million, or $219 per  megawatt hour.  Michael Worm, an analyst with the investment firm Gerald Klauer Mattison &  Co., said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices.  ""That's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time,"" he  said. ""Of course, they are dramatically higher than they used to be.""

"State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected  Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests  Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, March 16, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying  electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential  document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle.  State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging  $49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers  figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests.  The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources,  which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of  lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom  Hannigan.  To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much  California is spending on power purchases.  Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed,  it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw  it.  ""I don't think it was a surprise,"" said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R-  Redding.  Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity,  analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could  jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term.  For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education  programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst  warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in  Davis' proposed budget.  Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit  rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the  utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a  credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans  to rise.  ""This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect,"" said Jean Ross, executive  director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that  tracks state spending. ""Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the  energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look  like in the future.""  The biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent  nearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour. The smallest  day was March 10 when the state buyers spent $40 million, or $219 per  megawatt hour.  Michael Worm, an analyst with the investment firm Gerald Klauer Mattison &  Co., said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices.  ""That's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time,"" he  said. ""Of course, they are dramatically higher than they used to be.""  The governor's office has refused to release information on how much the  state has spent, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. Maviglio said if  generators found out how much the state spent the day before, they could  force up the price the next day.  But Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the public had a right  to know how its money way being spent.  ""People need to know exactly what it is costing to keep the lights on,"" he  said. ""We want to know the whole story -- not just pieces.""  Strickland, along with media organizations including The Chronicle, have  filed public records act requests to obtain information on how much the state  has spent, along with the details of long-term power contracts signed by  Davis.  The original bill that authorized the state to purchase power appropriated  only $500 million, but allowed the governor to use up to $10 billion if  needed for power purchases by notifying lawmakers. The governor's office has  sent five letters since Feb. 5 to lawmakers notifying them that additional  money was needed.  Based on these letters, which in total have requested an additional $2.5  billion, the news media and lawmakers estimated that the state was spending  $43 million a day -- $6 million less than the actual costs shown on the Water  Resources document.  Since the state began purchasing electricity, the health of its budget has  become dependent on a variety of things to come, making it as fragile as a  house of cards.  The money spent on power is taken from the state's general fund and is  supposed to be returned through the issuance of state bonds. The bonds will  be paid for with a portion of the rates that utility customers pay every  month.  -  Tell Us What You Think Can you save 20 percent on your energy usage? Gov.

"State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected  Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests  Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, March 16, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying  electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential  document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle.  State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging  $49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers  figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests.  The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources,  which purchases power on behalf of the state.

"State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected  Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests  Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, March 16, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying  electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential  document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle.  State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging  $49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers  figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests.  The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources,  which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of  lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom  Hannigan.  To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much  California is spending on power purchases.  Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed,  it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw  it.  ""I don't think it was a surprise,"" said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R-  Redding.  Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity,  analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could  jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term.  For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education  programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst  warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in  Davis' proposed budget.  Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit  rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the  utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a  credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans  to rise.  ""This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect,"" said Jean Ross, executive  director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that  tracks state spending. ""Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the  energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look  like in the future.""  The biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent  nearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour. The smallest  day was March 10 when the state buyers spent $40 million, or $219 per  megawatt hour.  Michael Worm, an analyst with the investment firm Gerald Klauer Mattison &  Co., said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices.  ""That's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time,"" he  said. ""Of course, they are dramatically higher than they used to be.""  The governor's office has refused to release information on how much the  state has spent, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. Maviglio said if  generators found out how much the state spent the day before, they could  force up the price the next day.  But Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the public had a right  to know how its money way being spent.  ""People need to know exactly what it is costing to keep the lights on,"" he  said. ""We want to know the whole story -- not just pieces.""  Strickland, along with media organizations including The Chronicle, have  filed public records act requests to obtain information on how much the state  has spent, along with the details of long-term power contracts signed by  Davis.  The original bill that authorized the state to purchase power appropriated  only $500 million, but allowed the governor to use up to $10 billion if  needed for power purchases by notifying lawmakers. The governor's office has  sent five letters since Feb. 5 to lawmakers notifying them that additional  money was needed.  Based on these letters, which in total have requested an additional $2.5  billion, the news media and lawmakers estimated that the state was spending  $43 million a day -- $6 million less than the actual costs shown on the Water  Resources document.

State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging  $49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers  figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests.  The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources,  which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of  lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom  Hannigan.  To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much  California is spending on power purchases.  Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed,  it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw  it.  ""I don't think it was a surprise,"" said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R-  Redding.  Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity,  analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could  jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term.  For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education  programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst  warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in  Davis' proposed budget.  Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit  rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the  utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a  credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans  to rise.  ""This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect,"" said Jean Ross, executive  director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that  tracks state spending. ""Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the  energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look  like in the future.""  The biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent  nearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour. The smallest  day was March 10 when the state buyers spent $40 million, or $219 per  megawatt hour.  Michael Worm, an analyst with the investment firm Gerald Klauer Mattison &  Co., said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices.  ""That's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time,"" he  said. ""Of course, they are dramatically higher than they used to be.""  The governor's office has refused to release information on how much the  state has spent, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. Maviglio said if  generators found out how much the state spent the day before, they could  force up the price the next day.  But Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the public had a right  to know how its money way being spent.  ""People need to know exactly what it is costing to keep the lights on,"" he  said. ""We want to know the whole story -- not just pieces.""  Strickland, along with media organizations including The Chronicle, have  filed public records act requests to obtain information on how much the state  has spent, along with the details of long-term power contracts signed by  Davis.  The original bill that authorized the state to purchase power appropriated  only $500 million, but allowed the governor to use up to $10 billion if  needed for power purchases by notifying lawmakers. The governor's office has  sent five letters since Feb. 5 to lawmakers notifying them that additional  money was needed.  Based on these letters, which in total have requested an additional $2.5  billion, the news media and lawmakers estimated that the state was spending  $43 million a day -- $6 million less than the actual costs shown on the Water  Resources document.  Since the state began purchasing electricity, the health of its budget has  become dependent on a variety of things to come, making it as fragile as a  house of cards.  The money spent on power is taken from the state's general fund and is  supposed to be returned through the issuance of state bonds. The bonds will  be paid for with a portion of the rates that utility customers pay every  month.  -  Tell Us What You Think Can you save 20 percent on your energy usage? Gov.

"State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected  Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests  Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, March 16, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying  electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential  document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle.  State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging  $49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers  figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests.  The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources,  which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of  lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom  Hannigan.  To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much  California is spending on power purchases.  Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed,  it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw  it.  ""I don't think it was a surprise,"" said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R-  Redding.  Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity,  analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could  jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term.  For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education  programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst  warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in  Davis' proposed budget.  Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit  rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the  utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a  credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans  to rise.  ""This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect,"" said Jean Ross, executive  director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that  tracks state spending. ""Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the  energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look  like in the future.""  The biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent  nearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour.

"State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected  Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests  Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, March 16, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying  electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential  document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle.  State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging  $49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers  figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests.  The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources,  which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of  lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom  Hannigan.  To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much  California is spending on power purchases.  Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed,  it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw  it.  ""I don't think it was a surprise,"" said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R-  Redding.  Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity,  analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could  jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term.  For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education  programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst  warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in  Davis' proposed budget.  Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit  rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the  utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a  credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans  to rise.  ""This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect,"" said Jean Ross, executive  director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that  tracks state spending. ""Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the  energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look  like in the future.""  The biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent  nearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour. The smallest  day was March 10 when the state buyers spent $40 million, or $219 per  megawatt hour.  Michael Worm, an analyst with the investment firm Gerald Klauer Mattison &  Co., said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices.  ""That's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time,"" he  said. ""Of course, they are dramatically higher than they used to be.""  The governor's office has refused to release information on how much the  state has spent, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. Maviglio said if  generators found out how much the state spent the day before, they could  force up the price the next day.  But Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the public had a right  to know how its money way being spent.  ""People need to know exactly what it is costing to keep the lights on,"" he  said. ""We want to know the whole story -- not just pieces.""  Strickland, along with media organizations including The Chronicle, have  filed public records act requests to obtain information on how much the state  has spent, along with the details of long-term power contracts signed by  Davis.  The original bill that authorized the state to purchase power appropriated  only $500 million, but allowed the governor to use up to $10 billion if  needed for power purchases by notifying lawmakers. The governor's office has  sent five letters since Feb. 5 to lawmakers notifying them that additional  money was needed.  Based on these letters, which in total have requested an additional $2.5  billion, the news media and lawmakers estimated that the state was spending  $43 million a day -- $6 million less than the actual costs shown on the Water  Resources document.  Since the state began purchasing electricity, the health of its budget has  become dependent on a variety of things to come, making it as fragile as a  house of cards.  The money spent on power is taken from the state's general fund and is  supposed to be returned through the issuance of state bonds. The bonds will  be paid for with a portion of the rates that utility customers pay every  month.  -  Tell Us What You Think Can you save 20 percent on your energy usage? Gov.

"State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected  Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests  Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, March 16, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying  electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential  document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle.  State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging  $49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers  figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests.  The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources,  which purchases power on behalf of the state.

To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much  California is spending on power purchases.

"State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected  Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests  Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, March 16, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying  electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential  document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle.  State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging  $49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers  figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests.  The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources,  which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of  lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom  Hannigan.  To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much  California is spending on power purchases.  Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed,  it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw  it.  ""I don't think it was a surprise,"" said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R-  Redding.  Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity,  analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could  jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term.  For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education  programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst  warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in  Davis' proposed budget.  Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit  rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the  utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a  credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans  to rise.  ""This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect,"" said Jean Ross, executive  director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that  tracks state spending. ""Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the  energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look  like in the future.""  The biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent  nearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour. The smallest  day was March 10 when the state buyers spent $40 million, or $219 per  megawatt hour.  Michael Worm, an analyst with the investment firm Gerald Klauer Mattison &  Co., said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices.  ""That's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time,"" he  said. ""Of course, they are dramatically higher than they used to be.""  The governor's office has refused to release information on how much the  state has spent, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. Maviglio said if  generators found out how much the state spent the day before, they could  force up the price the next day.  But Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the public had a right  to know how its money way being spent.  ""People need to know exactly what it is costing to keep the lights on,"" he  said. ""We want to know the whole story -- not just pieces.""  Strickland, along with media organizations including The Chronicle, have  filed public records act requests to obtain information on how much the state  has spent, along with the details of long-term power contracts signed by  Davis.  The original bill that authorized the state to purchase power appropriated  only $500 million, but allowed the governor to use up to $10 billion if  needed for power purchases by notifying lawmakers. The governor's office has  sent five letters since Feb. 5 to lawmakers notifying them that additional  money was needed.  Based on these letters, which in total have requested an additional $2.5  billion, the news media and lawmakers estimated that the state was spending  $43 million a day -- $6 million less than the actual costs shown on the Water  Resources document.

State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging  $49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers  figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests.  The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources,  which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of  lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom  Hannigan.  To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much  California is spending on power purchases.  Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed,  it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw  it.  ""I don't think it was a surprise,"" said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R-  Redding.  Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity,  analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could  jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term.  For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education  programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst  warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in  Davis' proposed budget.  Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit  rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the  utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a  credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans  to rise.  ""This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect,"" said Jean Ross, executive  director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that  tracks state spending. ""Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the  energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look  like in the future.""  The biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent  nearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour. The smallest  day was March 10 when the state buyers spent $40 million, or $219 per  megawatt hour.  Michael Worm, an analyst with the investment firm Gerald Klauer Mattison &  Co., said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices.  ""That's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time,"" he  said. ""Of course, they are dramatically higher than they used to be.""  The governor's office has refused to release information on how much the  state has spent, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. Maviglio said if  generators found out how much the state spent the day before, they could  force up the price the next day.  But Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the public had a right  to know how its money way being spent.  ""People need to know exactly what it is costing to keep the lights on,"" he  said. ""We want to know the whole story -- not just pieces.""  Strickland, along with media organizations including The Chronicle, have  filed public records act requests to obtain information on how much the state  has spent, along with the details of long-term power contracts signed by  Davis.  The original bill that authorized the state to purchase power appropriated  only $500 million, but allowed the governor to use up to $10 billion if  needed for power purchases by notifying lawmakers. The governor's office has  sent five letters since Feb. 5 to lawmakers notifying them that additional  money was needed.  Based on these letters, which in total have requested an additional $2.5  billion, the news media and lawmakers estimated that the state was spending  $43 million a day -- $6 million less than the actual costs shown on the Water  Resources document.  Since the state began purchasing electricity, the health of its budget has  become dependent on a variety of things to come, making it as fragile as a  house of cards.  The money spent on power is taken from the state's general fund and is  supposed to be returned through the issuance of state bonds. The bonds will  be paid for with a portion of the rates that utility customers pay every  month.  -  Tell Us What You Think Can you save 20 percent on your energy usage? Gov.

"State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected  Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests  Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, March 16, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying  electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential  document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle.  State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging  $49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers  figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests.  The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources,  which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of  lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom  Hannigan.  To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much  California is spending on power purchases.  Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed,  it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw  it.  ""I don't think it was a surprise,"" said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R-  Redding.  Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity,  analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could  jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term.  For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education  programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst  warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in  Davis' proposed budget.  Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit  rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the  utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a  credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans  to rise.  ""This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect,"" said Jean Ross, executive  director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that  tracks state spending.

"State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected  Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests  Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, March 16, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying  electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential  document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle.  State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging  $49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers  figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests.  The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources,  which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of  lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom  Hannigan.  To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much  California is spending on power purchases.  Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed,  it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw  it.  ""I don't think it was a surprise,"" said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R-  Redding.  Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity,  analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could  jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term.  For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education  programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst  warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in  Davis' proposed budget.  Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit  rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the  utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a  credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans  to rise.  ""This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect,"" said Jean Ross, executive  director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that  tracks state spending. ""Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the  energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look  like in the future.""  The biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent  nearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour. The smallest  day was March 10 when the state buyers spent $40 million, or $219 per  megawatt hour.  Michael Worm, an analyst with the investment firm Gerald Klauer Mattison &  Co., said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices.  ""That's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time,"" he  said. ""Of course, they are dramatically higher than they used to be.""  The governor's office has refused to release information on how much the  state has spent, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. Maviglio said if  generators found out how much the state spent the day before, they could  force up the price the next day.  But Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the public had a right  to know how its money way being spent.  ""People need to know exactly what it is costing to keep the lights on,"" he  said. ""We want to know the whole story -- not just pieces.""  Strickland, along with media organizations including The Chronicle, have  filed public records act requests to obtain information on how much the state  has spent, along with the details of long-term power contracts signed by  Davis.  The original bill that authorized the state to purchase power appropriated  only $500 million, but allowed the governor to use up to $10 billion if  needed for power purchases by notifying lawmakers. The governor's office has  sent five letters since Feb. 5 to lawmakers notifying them that additional  money was needed.  Based on these letters, which in total have requested an additional $2.5  billion, the news media and lawmakers estimated that the state was spending  $43 million a day -- $6 million less than the actual costs shown on the Water  Resources document.  Since the state began purchasing electricity, the health of its budget has  become dependent on a variety of things to come, making it as fragile as a  house of cards.  The money spent on power is taken from the state's general fund and is  supposed to be returned through the issuance of state bonds. The bonds will  be paid for with a portion of the rates that utility customers pay every  month.  -  Tell Us What You Think Can you save 20 percent on your energy usage? Gov.

"State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected  Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests  Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, March 16, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying  electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential  document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle.

"State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected  Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests  Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, March 16, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying  electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential  document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle.  State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging  $49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers  figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests.  The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources,  which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of  lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom  Hannigan.  To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much  California is spending on power purchases.  Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed,  it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw  it.  ""I don't think it was a surprise,"" said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R-  Redding.  Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity,  analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could  jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term.  For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education  programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst  warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in  Davis' proposed budget.  Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit  rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the  utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a  credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans  to rise.  ""This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect,"" said Jean Ross, executive  director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that  tracks state spending. ""Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the  energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look  like in the future.""  The biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent  nearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour. The smallest  day was March 10 when the state buyers spent $40 million, or $219 per  megawatt hour.  Michael Worm, an analyst with the investment firm Gerald Klauer Mattison &  Co., said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices.  ""That's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time,"" he  said. ""Of course, they are dramatically higher than they used to be.""  The governor's office has refused to release information on how much the  state has spent, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. Maviglio said if  generators found out how much the state spent the day before, they could  force up the price the next day.  But Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the public had a right  to know how its money way being spent.  ""People need to know exactly what it is costing to keep the lights on,"" he  said. ""We want to know the whole story -- not just pieces.""  Strickland, along with media organizations including The Chronicle, have  filed public records act requests to obtain information on how much the state  has spent, along with the details of long-term power contracts signed by  Davis.

"State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected  Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests  Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, March 16, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying  electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential  document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle.  State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging  $49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers  figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests.  The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources,  which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of  lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom  Hannigan.  To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much  California is spending on power purchases.  Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed,  it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw  it.  ""I don't think it was a surprise,"" said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R-  Redding.  Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity,  analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could  jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term.  For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education  programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst  warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in  Davis' proposed budget.  Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit  rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the  utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a  credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans  to rise.  ""This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect,"" said Jean Ross, executive  director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that  tracks state spending. ""Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the  energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look  like in the future.""  The biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent  nearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour. The smallest  day was March 10 when the state buyers spent $40 million, or $219 per  megawatt hour.  Michael Worm, an analyst with the investment firm Gerald Klauer Mattison &  Co., said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices.  ""That's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time,"" he  said. ""Of course, they are dramatically higher than they used to be.""  The governor's office has refused to release information on how much the  state has spent, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. Maviglio said if  generators found out how much the state spent the day before, they could  force up the price the next day.  But Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the public had a right  to know how its money way being spent.  ""People need to know exactly what it is costing to keep the lights on,"" he  said. ""We want to know the whole story -- not just pieces.""  Strickland, along with media organizations including The Chronicle, have  filed public records act requests to obtain information on how much the state  has spent, along with the details of long-term power contracts signed by  Davis.  The original bill that authorized the state to purchase power appropriated  only $500 million, but allowed the governor to use up to $10 billion if  needed for power purchases by notifying lawmakers. The governor's office has  sent five letters since Feb. 5 to lawmakers notifying them that additional  money was needed.  Based on these letters, which in total have requested an additional $2.5  billion, the news media and lawmakers estimated that the state was spending  $43 million a day -- $6 million less than the actual costs shown on the Water  Resources document.  Since the state began purchasing electricity, the health of its budget has  become dependent on a variety of things to come, making it as fragile as a  house of cards.  The money spent on power is taken from the state's general fund and is  supposed to be returned through the issuance of state bonds. The bonds will  be paid for with a portion of the rates that utility customers pay every  month.  -  Tell Us What You Think Can you save 20 percent on your energy usage? Gov.

"State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected  Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests  Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, March 16, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying  electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential  document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle.  State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging  $49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers  figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests.  The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources,  which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of  lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom  Hannigan.  To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much  California is spending on power purchases.  Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed,  it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw  it.  ""I don't think it was a surprise,"" said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R-  Redding.  Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity,  analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could  jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term.  For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education  programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst  warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in  Davis' proposed budget.

The bonds will  be paid for with a portion of the rates that utility customers pay every  month.  -  Tell Us What You Think Can you save 20 percent on your energy usage? Gov.  Gray Davis is offering rebates for Californians who save on power starting in  June, and if you've got a strategy for conserving, The Chronicle wants to  hear it.

"Mary, Enron Canada has 2 offices, one in Calgary and one in Toronto.  The  Toronto office was established to participate in all aspects of Enron  Canada's business, but principally, power trading, marketing and origination  after the de-regulation (or ""market opening"") of the Ontario power markets,  anticipated for the 2nd or 3rd quarter of 2001.  In response to your specific questions:  1. The Toronto office will be engaged in all aspects of trading, including  financial trading.  As with the Calgary office, it is my understanding that  all financial trading documentation will be handled as follows:   (a) financial master agreements (ISDA) and related collateral  annexes/guarantees/certificates/etc. will be negotiated and documented by  Houston Legal out of the Houston office under the supervision of Mark Taylor  and yourself;   (b) financial transaction documentation (i.e., confirmation  letters/GTCs/etc.) will be documented out of the Calgary office by Enron  Canada Operations/Documentation, under the supervision of Enron Canada Legal  where applicable;   (c) physical masters and related documentation will be negotiated and  documented out of the Calgary or Toronto office by Calgary/Toronto Legal, as  applicable, under my supervision; and    (d) all transaction documentation will be documented out of the Enron Canada  Documentation/Operations Group, under the supervision of Enron Canada Legal,  as appropriate.  2. All Canadian lawyers, including Chris Gaffney, report to me.  However,  Chris Gaffney has responsibility for legal matters regularly affecting the  Toronto office.  Therefore, you can co-ordinate directly with Chris, but  please keep me advised.  Chris regularly updates me with respect to Toronto  office matters.

"Christi,  As I have been thinking about this problem, my opposition to a standard  model is declining, partly out of frustration with the slow progress being  made.  I think, however, that we ought to think about the potential  consequences of recommending a standard model.  If we simply endorse PJM,  then we may inadvertently get its warts as well -- no secondary transmission  market, ICAP market, etc.  I think we are considering the same thing approach  as was reported by Charles Yeung's in his note on Tuesday's Inter-RTO  Coordination (Seams) Conference:  ""Harvey Reed, Constellation Power, suggested that FERC impose a standard  tariff for all RTOs to work from that did not restrict RTOs from filing  different proposals, but would limit their ability to diverge from a single  market model.""   In addition to the standard model, there needs to be a deadline for either  filing the tariff or for filing the standard tariff.  Without a ""feet to the  fire"" feature, nothing the grand stall will continue.  In arguing for a  standard model, the PJM system could be the core of a proposal but we should  specific modifications to address our concerns.  On the transmission rights  issue, for instance, a simple ""don't allocate"" solution won't work.  The lack  of the secondary market for NY TCCs or PJM FTRs goes both to the lack of  information and to the way the rights are defined.  If as Harvey Reed  suggests, RTOs can submit alternative approaches, at least there will be  pressure to get moving.  I have not discussed this idea with West Power.     It then occurred to me that FERC  is unlikely to impose a standard tariff  without a rulemaking proceeding.  Whether they could act by fiat or not is a  moot point, since  I doubt that they would do so without creating a record.   There are two possible down sides to a rule making.  (1)  The outcome of a  rulemaking is something of a crap shoot.  The incumbents have a pretty good  record in the past, of coming out of rulemakings with plenty of goodies such  as the native load exemption in Order No. 888.  There is a also a distinct  risk that PJM's ICAP or transmission right allocation process is given  blessed status, which will make revision of them later to be a huge uphill  battle.  (2)  The other consequence of a rulemaking its effect on current   RTO discussions.  The best outcome is that the uncertainty of the rulemaking  creates an urgency  to get a proposal filed before a new FERC rule cuts off  options from a new the standard for review.  The uncertainty prior to the  issuance of Order No. 888 in fact had that effect in the West.  On the other  hand it can mean that nothing happens until the new rule is issued.  This  also happened prior to Order No. 888, with a number of companies sitting on  their hands, using the time delay to protect existing positions, while  whipping up State regulators' fears of jurisdictional shift as necessary to  boost their own position.   These are only own views.  I have not had a chance to speak with West Power  this week, but I will approach Tim when I am in Portland again next week.

Bush wasn't smart enough to be president? ""He looked like some bozo at a church bazaar who sticks his head in a cutout hole while you get three shots at hitting him with a fastball,"" columnist Pete Hamill wrote back on August 13, a few days after the president gave a prime-time speech on stem cell research. ""He paused after every sixth or seventh word, as if afraid of skipping the next line in his script,"" Hamill sneered. Well, nobody's sneering now.  I'm putting ""Why George W. Bush is too Dumb to Be President"" at the top of my list of stories you won't read in 2002.

Bush September 16, 2001  Vist BushCountry.org today! http://www.bushcountry.org  ========================================================================  The Conflict Epidemic By Austin Bay  It was February 1990, three months after the Berlin Wall cracked and the Cold War began to melt. Following my lecture, she approached me in the school hallway. Despite the crowsfeet around her eyes, a tattling detail that pegged her on the high side of 40, she had decked herself in the perennially adolescent costume of a 1960s hippie: bandanna in the frizzed hair, faded blue jeans, and a pearl-button shirt best described as vaguely Navaho and LSD.  She smiled self-consciously, then raised a scold's finger: ""You write books about war, right? With the end of the Cold War and so many people waging peace, I guess you'll have to find another subject, eh?""  Read more at http://gopusa.com/austinbay/ab_010202.shtml  ========================================================================  Post-Christmas Wrap-Up By Frederick Meekins  Each year I write at least one column detailing the ongoing assault against Christmas throughout Western society.  Usually this affront is led by a gaggle of secularists, liberals, and multiculturalists. However, this year there seems to be a festering opposition led by certain Christians to the yuletide season. Even though these criticisms have not yet risen to the level of disruptive street theater engaged in by their unbelieving counterparts, they nevertheless reveal a somewhat dubious ecclesio-social philosophy.  The basic Christian anti-Christmas argument runs something like this: since the commemoration of Christmas is not explicitly commanded by Scripture, its celebration is therefore forbidden.  Furthermore, since certain aspects of the holiday might be traceable to pagan origins, the committed Christian is obligated to have no parts of them.

Looks fine as far as it goes ... but don't we want to explain how this fits  in to our strategy?  Is it just another platform for us to bring our products  and prices to the market?  We have said with respect to EOL that the  transaction is the goal not the platform.  Do we want to position this the  same way?  Examples of other press releases include our extension of pricing  on EOL to the two other platforms (including Houston Street) which we did a  couple of months ago.,11 Feb,steven.kean@enron.com,eval/kean-s_archiving_untitled_5929.txt.ann,KEAN-S,06:22:00,john.ambler@enron.com

"Cal-ISO: underscheduling caused grid failures    09/28/2000  Megawatt Daily  (c) Copyright 2000 Pasha Publications, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  Under-scheduling of load on the part of California's utilities caused  reliability problems in the state's electricity grid this summer, Ziad  Alaywan, the managing director of engineering and support at the California  Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) said. Speaking at a Cal-ISO stakeholder  meeting this week, Alaywan said Cal-ISO was forced to spend over $100 million  in out-of-market purchases this summer in order to cover unscheduled load not  purchased by the utilities in the day-ahead markets.  A confluence of factors added up to create the emergency situations the  Cal-ISO faced this summer, according to Alaywan. He cited arbitrage between  the California Power Exchange (Cal PX) and Cal-ISO markets, a reliance on  real-time (rather than day-ahead) markets and a general shortage of power  supply in California as reasons why California's power grid was stretched to  its limits this summer.  According to figures presented by Alaywan, the instance of under-scheduling  was some 50% higher this summer than in the two previous summers. This  under-scheduling resulted in a total of 36 stage 1 and 2 emergencies between  June 1 and August 15 and dictated that the ISO curtail 13,450 MW on 12  different occasions. In addition, the ISO spent $100,820,000 on out-of-market  electricity purchases during that period, up from $790,000 the previous year.  As a solution, Alaywan suggested increasing incentives to engage in forward  scheduling of power and that supply be increased. The Cal-ISO has made a  request for proposals for some 3000 MW for next summer to be used as a  peaking management tool, as well as allotting $800 million for transmission  upgrades over the next five years, Alaywan said.  Elena Schmid, Cal-ISO's vice president of strategic development and  communication, also speaking at the meeting cited insufficient generation,  inadequate transmission, under-scheduling of load, a lack of price responsive  demand, and the exercise of market power as market failures handicapping the  ISO's smooth delivery of power. To combat these shortcomings, Jeanne Sole, in  charge of long-term grid planning at the ISO, suggested that the ISO  encourage expansion of the gird and the competitive provision of electricity  for the California market. Changes must be made in the ISO and other entities  involved in power transmission and regulation over the next 18 months to  lessen the likelihood of such problems occurring in the future, the speakers  said.

He cited arbitrage between  the California Power Exchange (Cal PX) and Cal-ISO markets, a reliance on  real-time (rather than day-ahead) markets and a general shortage of power  supply in California as reasons why California's power grid was stretched to  its limits this summer.  According to figures presented by Alaywan, the instance of under-scheduling  was some 50% higher this summer than in the two previous summers. This  under-scheduling resulted in a total of 36 stage 1 and 2 emergencies between  June 1 and August 15 and dictated that the ISO curtail 13,450 MW on 12  different occasions. In addition, the ISO spent $100,820,000 on out-of-market  electricity purchases during that period, up from $790,000 the previous year.  As a solution, Alaywan suggested increasing incentives to engage in forward  scheduling of power and that supply be increased. The Cal-ISO has made a  request for proposals for some 3000 MW for next summer to be used as a  peaking management tool, as well as allotting $800 million for transmission  upgrades over the next five years, Alaywan said.  Elena Schmid, Cal-ISO's vice president of strategic development and  communication, also speaking at the meeting cited insufficient generation,  inadequate transmission, under-scheduling of load, a lack of price responsive  demand, and the exercise of market power as market failures handicapping the  ISO's smooth delivery of power. To combat these shortcomings, Jeanne Sole, in  charge of long-term grid planning at the ISO, suggested that the ISO  encourage expansion of the gird and the competitive provision of electricity  for the California market. Changes must be made in the ISO and other entities  involved in power transmission and regulation over the next 18 months to  lessen the likelihood of such problems occurring in the future, the speakers  said.

"Cal-ISO: underscheduling caused grid failures    09/28/2000  Megawatt Daily  (c) Copyright 2000 Pasha Publications, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  Under-scheduling of load on the part of California's utilities caused  reliability problems in the state's electricity grid this summer, Ziad  Alaywan, the managing director of engineering and support at the California  Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) said.

"Beth, Mark -   I think we are ready to move on implementing flat screen monitors in all of  Enron Building passenger elevator cabs, i.e. proposal is for two 14"" monitors  per cab, one for Corporate content, other for local Houston messages.

Technical details have generally been worked out between our group (Steve  Woods and Harry Grubbs) and Enron's IT Dept.  such that  we know total costs  are below $500K (more in $350-400K range plus whatever temporary,  non-elevator monitors appropriate for Three Allen Center occupants).  We have  a 3 month implementation schedule.

Please give me a call and we can discuss.  Shari is now definately moving to  power trading (not public yet) so we really need to figure out how we are  going to cover all the bases - short and long term.  I will be out the 14th  through the 17th and plan to be in S.A. the last week in March.  It would be  grea if we could both be there for the second seminar (looks like the more  pertinent to our issues) but I hate to think of Carol left all by herself  that much.  Let's see what we can figure out to make sure everything is  covered.,1 Mar,mark.taylor@enron.com,eval/taylor-m_all_documents_1449.txt.ann,Taylor-M,02:56:00,sara.shackleton@enron.com

"Duke is holding a news conference at 3pm Central Time.  Call in number is  below.    Duke Energy Offers Governor Davis Solutions to California's Power Supply  Shortfall        Committing to Deliver 3,000 Megawatts of New Supply to California                And a Five-Year Fixed Price Supply Contract      HOUSTON AND MOSS LANDING, Calif., July 31 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy North America (DENA) today offered to California Governor Gray Davis specific solutions to address the state's electricity supply shortage proposing to deliver 3,000 megawatts of new supply through the construction of generation facilities.  In addition, DENA proposed a five-year, fixed-price supply contract to incumbent utilities to address the immediate concern with volatile electricity prices.     ""California's high electricity prices during peak-demand periods result from insufficient supply to meet the demand,"" said Jim Donnell, president and chief executive officer of DENA.  ""In the past ten years, no significant new power generation facilities have been built in California.  During the same period, peak demand has risen more than 10,000 megawatts.  This combination has caused the state's reserve margin to fall to less than 2 percent, which necessarily results in higher prices and abnormal volatility.""     Under current procedures, it takes in excess of four years to deliver new power generation in California.  To add substantial incremental generating capacity to California, DENA proposed Governor Davis use his existing authority under the California Emergency Services Act to streamline the permitting process to facilitate the rapid construction of environmentally friendly generation by 2001.  DENA also asked the governor to use his current authority to allow California utilities to enter into bilateral contracts with energy providers, so they could better manage their exposure to high energy prices.     To help solve the state's supply shortfall, DENA said it remained committed to adding substantial generation in California.  Within two months and upon receiving final regulatory approvals, the company will begin construction on 1,000 megawatts at its Moss Landing facility.  The expansion of the current 1,478-megawatt facility will be in commercial operation by summer 2002.  And, with an expedited permitting process, DENA could deploy its available resources to construct an additional 500 megawatts for commercial operation in 2001 and 1,500 megawatts for 2002.     To address the concern associated with the high energy prices experienced this year, DENA offered to provide up to 2,000 megawatts of electricity to the incumbent utilities at $50 per megawatt-hour for a five-year period beginning Sept. 1, 2000.  This would mitigate the exposure to price spikes, for a reasonable time period during which additional generation resources can be built.     ""DENA is committed to help bring electricity price stability for the citizens of California through these proposals,"" Donnell said.  ""We are confident that our expertise in building and operating power generation facilities can help resolve the supply crisis.""     Duke Energy North America (DENA), is a leading wholesale energy services company.

This would mitigate the exposure to price spikes, for a reasonable time period during which additional generation resources can be built.

"Class Action Lawsuits Alleging Restraint of Trade and Unfair Business  Practices Filed Against SoCal Gas, San Diego Gas & Electric, And El Paso  Natural Gas  LOS ANGELES, Dec. 18 /PRNewswire/  via NewsEdge Corporation  - Two related class action lawsuits have been filed in the California Superior Court in Los Angeles, against Southern California Gas Company, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company, Sempra Energy (parent of the two utilities), El Paso Natural Gas Co., and other companies related to El Paso Natural Gas.  The two lawsuits allege a conspiracy resulting in restraint of trade and unfair competition and unlawful business practices.  The complaints summarize the issue as follows:  This action involves a massive conspiracy to eliminate competition in the newly deregulated energy industry that has resulted in endangering California's electrical system and threatening California's economy.  It is perhaps the largest gouging of energy consumers in American history. Southern California's current ""energy crisis"" is not simply the result of ever-increasing demand by a growing population for energy.  Rather, it is the direct result of a conspiracy among the natural gas industry's most powerful Southern California players to preserve and maintain the market dominance that they enjoyed for many years as monopolies subject to regulation.  When the artificial monopoly created by regulation was disassembled, those dominant companies took prompt and illegal action to ensure that they would not lose the benefits of their market power.  Their unlawful collusion has contributed significantly to the recent astronomical increases in the price of natural gas and electricity.  As a result, Southern California customers have had to pay billions of dollars extra for their natural gas and electric needs.  This lawsuit seeks to recover those damages. (Para. 1 and 2 of complaint.)   ""In September of 1996, top executives of Southern California Gas Company (""SoCal Gas""), San Diego Gas &amp; Electric (""SDG&amp;E"") and El Paso Natural  Gas Corporation (""EPNG"") met at the Embassy Suites Hotel, near Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix, Arizona.  Fearing a new era of open competition and lower prices, these latter day captains of industry gathered secretly to hatch a conspiracy to dominate the unregulated aspects of the natural gas and electricity markets.  At the meeting, these three companies, who together dominate the Southern California natural gas market, illegally agreed not to compete against each other in the Southern California and Baja California natural gas delivery markets.  They also conspired to prevent other pipelines from being built that would have competed against them and lowered natural gas prices in these markets.  The conspirators sought to eliminate competition, take advantage of electric deregulation, drive up the price of natural gas, and profit from the increased prices."" (Para 4 of complaint.)   One of the two lawsuits addresses the effects of the conspiracy on natural gas prices; the other deals with the effects on electricity prices. (The price of gas-fired generation establishes the price for most of the electricity used in Southern California.)  Copies of the two lawsuits filed this morning are available as Adobe Acrobat (PDF) files on the web site of the law firm of O'Donnell and Shaeffer at http://oslaw.com/osnews.  Attorneys representing the plaintiffs are available for interviews, and can also provide additional materials, including copies of the agenda prepared for the secret meeting, as well as graphics illustrating the location of natural gas pipelines that were planned, but then terminated by the defendants following the secret meeting in Phoenix.

Many see constructing new power plants as the sole solution for bringing prices down.  However, E SOURCE research just out of the field indicates that convincing customers to reduce their electricity demand in exchange for cash could provide tremendous price relief in open power markets.  ""Our study shows that commercial and industrial customers are very willing to reduce demand if the price is right, if mechanisms are in place for communicating those prices, and if they have a means of controlling their electric loads.  We found that larger customers could offer almost 20 percent of their load as negawatts -- temporary reductions in electricity demand,"" says E SOURCE Vice President Bill LeBlanc.  Because most electricity use is considered essential and rising wholesale prices don't immediately affect end users, prices can go sky high when power supplies get tight.  But if demand dropped in response to high prices, LeBlanc contends that overall power costs would be much lower.  He explains, ""Although there's a disconnect between price and demand in the marketplace today, we've uncovered a significant subset of customers who seem ready to participate in a dynamic pricing market.  Unfortunately, most of them don't yet have the communication and control tools that would make load management possible. They also haven't been offered a pricing product they like.""  The E SOURCE research study confirms that customers want flexibility in deciding whether to participate in load reductions on a daily or even hourly basis, as just one example.  So how many negawatts are available?  According to the E SOURCE national market survey, medium-to-large commercial and industrial customers could potentially reduce their demand by 18 percent if offered a market price of $1 per kWh (one of the tested price points) for reduced electricity usage.  At this price -- which, incidentally, is what Edison International CEO and President John Bryson reported that his company paid for electricity on December 12 in wholesale power markets -- about 55,000 MW could be made available across the U.S., and about 4,800 MW in California.  LeBlanc adds, ""We can't expect to capture all of this potential.  But with the right product, pricing scheme, and marketing, it would be possible to help relieve price pressure on the whole system.""  The E SOURCE study, ""Energy Pricing and Load Management:  What Do End-Users Want?"" can help energy service providers design appropriate products and identify the customer groups most likely to participate in such programs.  It's based on an extensive research with over 700 energy decision-makers across the U.S. and Canada.

Many see constructing new power plants as the sole solution for bringing prices down.  However, E SOURCE research just out of the field indicates that convincing customers to reduce their electricity demand in exchange for cash could provide tremendous price relief in open power markets.  ""Our study shows that commercial and industrial customers are very willing to reduce demand if the price is right, if mechanisms are in place for communicating those prices, and if they have a means of controlling their electric loads.  We found that larger customers could offer almost 20 percent of their load as negawatts -- temporary reductions in electricity demand,"" says E SOURCE Vice President Bill LeBlanc.  Because most electricity use is considered essential and rising wholesale prices don't immediately affect end users, prices can go sky high when power supplies get tight.  But if demand dropped in response to high prices, LeBlanc contends that overall power costs would be much lower.  He explains, ""Although there's a disconnect between price and demand in the marketplace today, we've uncovered a significant subset of customers who seem ready to participate in a dynamic pricing market.  Unfortunately, most of them don't yet have the communication and control tools that would make load management possible. They also haven't been offered a pricing product they like.""  The E SOURCE research study confirms that customers want flexibility in deciding whether to participate in load reductions on a daily or even hourly basis, as just one example.  So how many negawatts are available?  According to the E SOURCE national market survey, medium-to-large commercial and industrial customers could potentially reduce their demand by 18 percent if offered a market price of $1 per kWh (one of the tested price points) for reduced electricity usage.  At this price -- which, incidentally, is what Edison International CEO and President John Bryson reported that his company paid for electricity on December 12 in wholesale power markets -- about 55,000 MW could be made available across the U.S., and about 4,800 MW in California.

"Class Action Lawsuits Alleging Restraint of Trade and Unfair Business  Practices Filed Against SoCal Gas, San Diego Gas & Electric, And El Paso  Natural Gas  LOS ANGELES, Dec. 18 /PRNewswire/  via NewsEdge Corporation  - Two related class action lawsuits have been filed in the California Superior Court in Los Angeles, against Southern California Gas Company, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company, Sempra Energy (parent of the two utilities), El Paso Natural Gas Co., and other companies related to El Paso Natural Gas.  The two lawsuits allege a conspiracy resulting in restraint of trade and unfair competition and unlawful business practices.  The complaints summarize the issue as follows:  This action involves a massive conspiracy to eliminate competition in the newly deregulated energy industry that has resulted in endangering California's electrical system and threatening California's economy.  It is perhaps the largest gouging of energy consumers in American history. Southern California's current ""energy crisis"" is not simply the result of ever-increasing demand by a growing population for energy.  Rather, it is the direct result of a conspiracy among the natural gas industry's most powerful Southern California players to preserve and maintain the market dominance that they enjoyed for many years as monopolies subject to regulation.  When the artificial monopoly created by regulation was disassembled, those dominant companies took prompt and illegal action to ensure that they would not lose the benefits of their market power.  Their unlawful collusion has contributed significantly to the recent astronomical increases in the price of natural gas and electricity.  As a result, Southern California customers have had to pay billions of dollars extra for their natural gas and electric needs.  This lawsuit seeks to recover those damages. (Para. 1 and 2 of complaint.)   ""In September of 1996, top executives of Southern California Gas Company (""SoCal Gas""), San Diego Gas &amp; Electric (""SDG&amp;E"") and El Paso Natural  Gas Corporation (""EPNG"") met at the Embassy Suites Hotel, near Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix, Arizona.  Fearing a new era of open competition and lower prices, these latter day captains of industry gathered secretly to hatch a conspiracy to dominate the unregulated aspects of the natural gas and electricity markets.  At the meeting, these three companies, who together dominate the Southern California natural gas market, illegally agreed not to compete against each other in the Southern California and Baja California natural gas delivery markets.  They also conspired to prevent other pipelines from being built that would have competed against them and lowered natural gas prices in these markets.  The conspirators sought to eliminate competition, take advantage of electric deregulation, drive up the price of natural gas, and profit from the increased prices."" (Para 4 of complaint.)

""Our study shows that commercial and industrial customers are very willing to reduce demand if the price is right, if mechanisms are in place for communicating those prices, and if they have a means of controlling their electric loads.  We found that larger customers could offer almost 20 percent of their load as negawatts -- temporary reductions in electricity demand,"" says E SOURCE Vice President Bill LeBlanc.  Because most electricity use is considered essential and rising wholesale prices don't immediately affect end users, prices can go sky high when power supplies get tight.  But if demand dropped in response to high prices, LeBlanc contends that overall power costs would be much lower.  He explains, ""Although there's a disconnect between price and demand in the marketplace today, we've uncovered a significant subset of customers who seem ready to participate in a dynamic pricing market.  Unfortunately, most of them don't yet have the communication and control tools that would make load management possible. They also haven't been offered a pricing product they like.""  The E SOURCE research study confirms that customers want flexibility in deciding whether to participate in load reductions on a daily or even hourly basis, as just one example.  So how many negawatts are available?  According to the E SOURCE national market survey, medium-to-large commercial and industrial customers could potentially reduce their demand by 18 percent if offered a market price of $1 per kWh (one of the tested price points) for reduced electricity usage.  At this price -- which, incidentally, is what Edison International CEO and President John Bryson reported that his company paid for electricity on December 12 in wholesale power markets -- about 55,000 MW could be made available across the U.S., and about 4,800 MW in California.

"Class Action Lawsuits Alleging Restraint of Trade and Unfair Business  Practices Filed Against SoCal Gas, San Diego Gas & Electric, And El Paso  Natural Gas  LOS ANGELES, Dec. 18 /PRNewswire/  via NewsEdge Corporation  - Two related class action lawsuits have been filed in the California Superior Court in Los Angeles, against Southern California Gas Company, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company, Sempra Energy (parent of the two utilities), El Paso Natural Gas Co., and other companies related to El Paso Natural Gas.  The two lawsuits allege a conspiracy resulting in restraint of trade and unfair competition and unlawful business practices.  The complaints summarize the issue as follows:  This action involves a massive conspiracy to eliminate competition in the newly deregulated energy industry that has resulted in endangering California's electrical system and threatening California's economy.  It is perhaps the largest gouging of energy consumers in American history. Southern California's current ""energy crisis"" is not simply the result of ever-increasing demand by a growing population for energy.  Rather, it is the direct result of a conspiracy among the natural gas industry's most powerful Southern California players to preserve and maintain the market dominance that they enjoyed for many years as monopolies subject to regulation.  When the artificial monopoly created by regulation was disassembled, those dominant companies took prompt and illegal action to ensure that they would not lose the benefits of their market power.  Their unlawful collusion has contributed significantly to the recent astronomical increases in the price of natural gas and electricity.  As a result, Southern California customers have had to pay billions of dollars extra for their natural gas and electric needs.  This lawsuit seeks to recover those damages.

"RAC came by and brought up a couple of concerns.  1- the Var on this deal is  over $120m (more than all of ENE combined); they wanted to make me aware of  the size, and they know we are working on it. and 2 - EE&CC; they were  concerned about them doing the deal and their abilities and effects on MTM  treatment.  I told them that they can bid on it but we want others to bid and  that we probably won't use them.  They stated that the deal guys are acting  like EE&CC is a done deal.  Lets discuss.

"I'm not sure.

After some hearty belly-laughing at his expense flowing from  the rich comedic theme of how we talk so sweet to our customers on the phone  and then hang up and curse their mortal souls with expletives deleted,    I   agreed with him that we need to ask the following question to those above  with more wisdom than we have:  When you do the physical leg of an EFP transaction,  must the delivery point  for the physical piece be identical to the delivery point of the futures  piece?    Shooting from the hip on the Casino floor without much substantive  explanation to go on, I said the answer to this question was absolutely yes  and the City of Vernon huffed and puffed and said they had done other deals  where the delivery points were different.  I made us document the deal as follows:  1. An undocumented Nymex transaction whereby our broker agreed with their  broker that we would buy 30 Palo Verde futures contracts from Vernon for $120.  2. Then, the Exchange of this futures position for a physical position was  documented as a physical trade whereby EPMI sold Vernon 30 MW at Palo Verde  for $120.  3. Then, because Vernon wanted to get out of their Palo Verde position, we  agreed to buy back the 30 Mw for $120 and this was documented as a phsical  transaction.  4.  Then, because Vernon needed the power at NP-15, we sold them 30 MW at  NP-15 for $116. (Don't get distracted by thinking about buying at $120 and  selling at $116 and losing money. The prices were good at both points as part  of our portfolio of deals.)    Vernon said we should have done step 1 and step 4 and not 2 and 3 and that  they do this all the time.

"Tori, I understand that Rosalee is out of the office. In her absence, I thought you  should be aware of the following.   PM Mori has confirmed that he is available to meet with Mr Lay on 1 November.  However, he has advised that he will be unable to attend the office opening.  Parliament is in session at the moment and budget debate has been delayed as  a result of extended debate on the amendment to the electoral rules. The PM  has advised that he will be in budget deliberations on the 31st.  The PM has proposed that he be represented at the office opening by his #2 -  Hidenao Nakagawa  -  Minister of State and Chief Cabinet Secretary. Nakagawa,  as Minister of State, is Japan's official spokesperson and will open the  office in the name of the PM.  Nakagawa is generally regarded as being responsible for the PM's policy  direction and plays a vital role in supporting PM Mori's fragile leadership.  Significantly, Nakagawa is currently responsible for the government's  Information Technology (IT) policies, the Government's most important  initiative at present. He is vice-chair of the Government's IT Strategy  Conference and  formerly held the post of Vice Minister of MITI.  In my view, this is not a bad outcome.

"Tori, I understand that Rosalee is out of the office. In her absence, I thought you  should be aware of the following.   PM Mori has confirmed that he is available to meet with Mr Lay on 1 November.  However, he has advised that he will be unable to attend the office opening.  Parliament is in session at the moment and budget debate has been delayed as  a result of extended debate on the amendment to the electoral rules. The PM  has advised that he will be in budget deliberations on the 31st.  The PM has proposed that he be represented at the office opening by his #2 -  Hidenao Nakagawa  -  Minister of State and Chief Cabinet Secretary. Nakagawa,  as Minister of State, is Japan's official spokesperson and will open the  office in the name of the PM.

I am fine to run with this copy from a legal perspective  unless Dick or Colleen had any comments.,9 Nov,gerald.nemec@enron.com,train/nemec-g_all_documents_1941.txt.ann,NEMEC-G,01:35:00,carl.carter@enron.com

"April 2, 2001  Via Email  Tana Jones Tana.jones@enron.com Enron  Dear Tana Jones:  The New York Mercantile Exchange is excited and we want to tell you why. NYMEX is about to launch enymexsm  and its prospects are invigorating.  Over-the-counter (OTC) participants will now be able to execute transactions on the same platform as NYMEX futures.  The Exchange plans to use its proven clearing infrastructure to introduce complete counter-party risk management, and create net margining with Exchange futures markets by calculating a consolidated clearing position.  Subsequent enymexsm functionality will also provide an internet-based interface to the established Exchange futures market by routing futures orders to the trading floor and the NYMEX ACCESSc electronic trading system, depending on the session.  Attached please find information announcing the first slate of products to be offered for listing on enymexsm .  Since we value your business as a forerunner in this industry, we are enclosing for your review the sale registration form, which consists of the enymexsm System User Agreement.  Please review, sign and return to Robert A. Dagistino, Director of Customer Service, New York Mercantile Exchange, One North End Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10282.  Any questions can be answered via email at rdagistino@nymex.com or via telephone at 212-299-2429.  The signatory must be an executive officer or partner of the firm.  We are also attaching two ""click-on screens"" that users will view when they first log on to the system.  Please note that since the enymexsm products will be cleared you will also need to obtain authorization from a clearing member for your account.  A NYMEX team, consisting of members of our Board, local traders and staff, will be visiting each one of you in person.  They will discuss with you how to utilize the benefits of NYMEX to achieve precision in many of your customized transactions.  We look forward to receiving your registration and participation in what is intended to be the premier, global exchange for forward trading and clearing contracts focusing on energy and metals products.  Sincerely,   <<...OLE_Obj...>> Neal Wolkoff, Executive Vice President   <<enymex information.doc>>  <<enymex system user agreement.doc>> <<clickonscreensfinal3282001.doc>>   - enymex information.doc  - enymex system user agreement.doc  - clickonscreensfinal3282001.doc",2 Apr,edotson@nymex.com,train/jones-t_trading_issues_13.txt.ann,JONES-T,11:57:00,tana.jones@enron.com

"550206 - price is in correctly at $187.27 because this deal is a sale from  EPMI to EES  (550205 is the deal where EPMI buys from EES - price is therefore $5 less  than weighted average, making it $177.27)  552990 - price is in at $195 off peak and $295 on peak, which are the prices  reflected in my worksheet   Brooklyn may be looking at a price for a real time deal. If the desk is  Short Term West Hourly, that means the deal was done in the    hour-ahead,  not day-ahead market, and the price will be different.

"At the end of the Leadership Giving Campaign, EWS had reached $488,832 in pledges, which is 38.31% of our campaign goal of $1,276,000.

"I will mail the checks and money to Barb.  There was one other item that I was going to deliver to you.  One of the women who had prepared snacks for the last general meeting turnedin the recipe for her pumpkin dip.  She said that many people were asking her for it, and if we had room, maybe we could publish it in the newsletter.  I told her that we would have to see how much official material we have from the chapter and if we wind up with a needed ""filler"".  Let me know if you do need a filler, and I can send the recipe via an attachment.  Feel free to call me at work - 713-853-5926.  I have the recipe in my briefcase.    Glad Nancy got back to you on the food drive - or lack there of!   At fall regional training, I attended a Communications session - they provided a list by month of desired national information (from the national website) to be included in our newsletters.  Had planned to drop that off as well.  I am still at home right now, but I can fax that to you when I get to the office a little later.     Thanks again for all of your hard work!!! --Sally",23 Oct,sally.beck@enron.com,train/beck-s_sent_items_318.txt.ann,Beck-S,06:01:38,rgladstein@aol.com

"As you all know, the recruiting season is in full swing and the AA Program's recruiters are hitting campus as we speak.  One of the most important parts of the process and a key to Enron's future success are the Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday interview dates where we make the selections on those candidates who will receive offers from Enron for the 2002 recruiting class.  It is important that these candidates be interviewed by business leaders from each business unit and specifically those who utilize AA pool members.  Our goal is for each business unit to identify a core group of interviewers for each of the four interview weekends which will be held as follows:    Dates      Total Number of Interviewers Needed**  October 25-26           Fantastic Friday - Analysts   100  30 for dinner/70 for interview         November 2 -4 -        Super Saturday - Associates  100  30 for dinner/70 for interview   November 15-16        Fantastic Friday - Analysts   100  30 for dinner/70 for interview November 30-Dec 1   Super Saturday - Associates  100  30 for dinner/70 for interview  I have attached a list of those individuals in various business units that have participated in the interview process in the past for your review (as a sample of the type of individual we are looking for as interviewers).  Please provide me a list of your business unit's interviewers by date by Friday, October 5.  Individuals are encouraged to interview more than one selected date and we will forward details to them at least a week prior to the interview date.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.  Thanks again for all your help.  Ted and Traci    **  We do not expect you to provide all the interviewers.  This number reflects to total needed from all business units and will include those needed for both the evening and interview days..",26 Sep,c..bland@enron.com,train/buy-r_inbox_1011.txt.ann,Buy-R,11:38:58,richard.causey@enron.com

Maybe you should write a book (or article) sometime on ""Keys to Snagging the Right Employee!"".  Good news about Dad, huh?   So glad you were able to get him to see your doctor to start the ball rolling on finding new answers for him.   It is a lot of work to find the right answers for our healthcare!  We are starting to think more about the baby's room . . .  I think we're leaning towards using your bed, if that's still okay.   Did you say that the changing table would be available, too?  Is it light wood also? I think we will probably get our own bed linens - but what do your look like?   Boyish?   Do you think it's better to use a rocker or a glider?  Sorry we didn't make it for a fall trip.   It seems that almost every weekend one of us has been gone - Chris leaves for Asia on Thursday for 2 weeks - it's a nonstop whirlwind of travel!  Thanksgiving should be fun . . . what shall we bring?     Is there any sort of a plan for Friday?

My recommendation is  that you plan on arriving at 7:00 or later.  Hopefully by that time my old  manager will have had enough to drink he won't mind all these other people on  his tab.  I must admit, the job just keeps sounding better and better.  P.S.

"I have completed internal feedback forms through the PEP system for Brent  Price, Bob Hall and Peggy Hedstrom.  Those appeared to be the only names that  you included for which you wanted my input.  Somehow, from Andrea's voice  mail message last week, I had anticipated responding to more requests - I  thought perhaps input in working with Wes within ENA or Melissa on SAP.   Those weren't  on my list within the PEP system, so I just wanted you to know  that I have responded to the three that were there.  If there was intent for  me to respond to any others, they weren't accessible in the system. (Believe  me, I am not asking for more - just wanted to be sure that what I saw in PEP  as a request matched your expectations in terms of my response).  --Sally",29 Dec,sally.beck@enron.com,train/beck-s_discussion_threads_3507.txt.ann,Beck-S,10:02:00,richard.causey@enron.com

"Per your request, here is my summary of the conversations that we have had to  date about complying with the new marketing affiliate requirements in  Standard L.  Frazier, Maria or Susan -- jump in if I missed something.    New Standard L Requirements  Shared Employees.  Reporting on shared employees & facilities (161.3  (l)(2)(i) and 161.3(l)(2)(ii)(c) is the easy part -- as we have no shared  employees and I think we have only minor shared facilities which are  disclosed in our standards of conduct.  Thus, we may want to tackle the  shared facilities by posting our Standards of Conduct.  Relative Position of Entities in the Organization.  With respect to 161.3(l)  (ii)(A).  Frazier has put together a idea about showing the relative position  of the pipeline and the marketing affiliates in the corporate structure.   Here's a sample of how the Northern reporting chain would look:   Enron Corp.  Enron Pipeline Holding Company   Enron Operations Corp.    Enron Pipeline Company     Northern Natural Gas   Pipeline Org. Charts, Titles, Job Descriptions (and names of supervisory  employees).  Section 161.3(l)(ii)(B) is probably the hardest part of the new  requirements.  Frazier took the task of getting with HR to pull together  initial org charts, titles and descriptions.  Since then I saw the new SAP  employee system which lists job titles & descriptions.  Perhaps HR can get  the information from there.  My ""to do"" is to get a couple samples of how the  similar employee org. chart data is presented on the electric side in OASIS.   Bambi -- I'll make sure to include you in our next discussion.  Frazier -  have you had a chance to talk with HR -- let us know when you are ready to  get back together to discuss.",10 Jul,shelley.corman@enron.com,train/scott-s_all_documents_425.txt.ann,SCOTT-S,08:29:00,bambi.heckerman@enron.com

At Monday's board meeting, Lori Ewalt gave me an article about Senior Presentation for the December newsletter.  She doesn't have an electronic copy.  I will try this weekend to retype it as a word document and e-mail it to you.  Lori also said that she had given Janet Petrak a hard copy of a permission slip to be printed in the December newsletter.  (This is for parents to sign for under 17's to be out after midnight as they return from Senior Presentation).  Do you have that?  If not, you might contact Janet and ask her for that.  --Sally",7 Nov,sally.beck@enron.com,train/beck-s_sent_items_478.txt.ann,Beck-S,08:54:17,rgladstein@aol.com

"Chris, the simple fact, which we know from past experience and which OPG is  missing, is that there is a large segment of counterparties who for various  reasons (logistics/scheduling fixed-priced physical requirements for term  with a with a marketer; corporate authorizations for physical transacting  only; industrial culture; commercial sophistication; etc) will only want to  transact physically.  To ignore this is to ignore a large segment of the  market.    If OPG wants out of the process I nonetheless urge you to continue as I am  confident that once the market opens, or gets closer to opening, they will  realize this.  If they want to compete fully in the trading business they  will come back to what the industry is using for physical settlement, which  is the EEI form you will have developed.  I also think that OPG is missing the point on physical settlement.  As we  discussed the IMO is merely the pool settlement mechanism.  That does not  mean that the underlying transaction cannot be a physical bilateral which  allocates physical settlement risk as between the parties for physical  delivery obligations (such as for failure to deliver; increased costs and  prudential support for failure to deliver even where the IMO mechanism makes  up the deficiency volume; force majeure; volume management; etc).  I think it can be said in all markets that in many cases the distinctions  between physical and financial trading can be distinctions without a  difference, but nonetheless there are some real distinctions and more  importantly, even if there are no differences, certain counterparties will  only want to deal in what they believe to be a physically settled product.   So it seems you are close with the other counterparties, and I suggest you  just march on with them if OPG does not want to participate further.

"Chip,  I wanted to follow up regarding the issues that were raised by the cash committee relative to LRCI and our request for approx $300k to pay Dow under our lease on storage caverns #13/#14.  David Zdunkewicz, an A&K bankruptcy lawyer, was asked to consider whether it might be prudent to have the 4 Enron Partners (LRC, LRCI, LGMC, and LGMI) file voluntary petitions in bankruptcy.  The reason to do this would be primarily driven by the flexibility that it would afford the cash committee to fund some of the Enron Partner's liabilities.  It was thought that such a bankruptcy might also have the effect of invalidating the consent right that Texaco currently has on sales of the partnership interests pursuant to the Partnership Agreement.  David indicated, from his firm's preliminary review, that the potential negatives outweigh the possible advantages for the following reasons:  1)  Filing for bankruptcy may result in a claim by Texaco that the partnership agreement is an executory contract and that Texaco could reject any attempt by the Enron Partners to assume the contract.  This would result in a deemed default by the Enron Partners under the Partnership Agreement notwithstanding the absence of any specific default language for a partner's bankruptcy; and   2)  The rights of Texaco to consent to any transfer of the Enron Partner's partnership interest would not, as previously thought, be invalidated by any bankruptcy.  All of this may be moot as Brian Redmond has secured a preliminary agreement from Bridgeline to pay Dow directly (since they have the obligation to reimburse these amounts anyway).  If that doesn't come to fruition, however, these findings will be important.  Stuart",13 Dec,stuart.zisman@enron.com,train/nemec-g_inbox_1421.txt.ann,Nemec-G,10:31:54,chip.schneider@enron.com

More detail than you probably want on the document I gave you at the  Doubletree....  Mike was responding to an email that Steve Young had sent  him.  Just wanted you to know that this is moving forward and that I will  coordinate the Houston side of this for now (I will coordinate London going  forward if that responsibility is given to me).

"Hi Kate! I am beginning to see a familiar pattern beginning in the West (-familiar  because it's the same problem we have with East traders).  There are A LOT of  deals that need to be changed to ""no confirm.""  I'd like to fax a list of  them to you so that you can 1st, change their status in Deal Entry to ""not to  be confirmed"" and 2nd, bug the traders who enter the deals to remember to  enter them correctly.  Also, you mentioned working with Will Smith in IT to  get these deals to automatically be ""no confirm"" when the traders enter  them.  You may want to use some of these as examples so to help IT figure the  logic behind which deals are confirmed and which aren't.  Please let me know  your fax number so that i can send you this report.   Thanks!

"Kim -  I've finished changing the list of deals you faxed over to no confirm. Please  let me know if you continue to see these deals on your new deal report. I  still had questions on some of the Short Term and Long Term Northwest deals.  On those I will defer to Diana Scholtes. I also have questions on the  following deals:  557772 - why are we not confirming a daily with Pacificorp? 552516 - why are we not confirming a daily with Riverside?  And there were two deals I couldn't for the life of me read on that fax, so  you may still see deals showing up that don't necessarily need to be  confirmed.   Diana -  I know we had decided not to confirm deals done with Portland General  Electric, but before I change the following deals to ""no confirm"" I want to  clarify under what conditions we do not confirm with this counterparty.  1. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is elsewhere (Mid-C,  Montana System, etc.), do we confirm?  2. If the counterparty is something other than PGE and the delivery point is  Portland General System, do we confirm?  3. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is Portland General  System, do we confirm?  I apologize for asking so many questions, but I've got a long list of deals  in front of me and before I create an irreparable mess I wanted to check that  I'm doing this right. Please let me know.  553666  553667 553668 555174 555175 555177 555178 556365 556366 556367 556368 557665 557666 557667 557668 557734 558952 558957 558958 558959 558960  Thank you both for all your help.

Most of you are aware that Unify experienced some major performance issues as  we tried to close out the month of July.  Not to go into any details but  there seemed to be a lot of smaller issues which when combined caused the  issues we saw on Monday and to a lesser degree on Tuesday.  Almost all of the  issues relate to the quirkiness of the current version of Sybase which is  used for Unify's database.  Jeff Johnson and his team are putting together a  plan that will address most of these issues and hopefully result in  acceptable performance as we go through next bidweek and try to close for  August.  The short term tactical plans include the following:  Enhancing certain programs which seem to have become resource hogs as the  amount of data grows. Test and hopefully migrate to the latest version of Sybase which will address  some of the issues.  This may also require some hardware changes as to where  we store certain data.  We will also need some user help in stress testing  prior to moving to production. Addressing with the users billing transactions that have never been finaled.   I have been told that we still have transactions going back to Jan of 99 that  have not been finaled or closed out.  This puts quite a load on the PMA and  accrual process since it has to go back to those open transactions to see  what if any action should be taken with these transactions.  Once these changes have been implemented and hopefully bought us a little  time to absorb the tremendous growth we've been seeing via EOL  then we will  focus on delivering more intermediate and longer term solutions.  These  include the following:  Rewriting most of the code and moving to a 3 tier environment which will be  much more scalable. Moving off of Sybase and on to Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle.  It will be  easier to move Microsoft SQL Server but we have to be sure it is the right  solution in the long term.  Jeff will be following up with some of you to go over a much more detailed  plan.  Needless to say that this is his groups highest priority and his best  people are working on these efforts.  This will slow down major enhancement  efforts such as enhancing the gas applications to handle hourly trades and  nominations.  We will keep you informed as we start to roll out the tactical  solutions.  In the mean time feel free to contact me at x-36858 or Jeff at  x-39694 if you have any questions or require additional detail.

"Traders et al:  This is the best article I saw on what the FERC may do on Monday.  We are hopeful (and doing lobbying to push for) for no action outside of California, given the unworkability and meaningless-ness of price controls outside of CA.  This is an effort and not a promise, of course.  Some action in CA seems more than 50-50 likely  and the best bet seem to be extending the current proxy mitigation to all hours.  The article below raises the possibility of reissuing the refund orders (recall that they began in March 01 for the month of January 01) to cover all hours and not just during Stage 3.  Such reissued refund order could extend back to Oct 00.  Alan Comnes    Wednesday, June 13, 2001   Federal Panel May Extend Price Limits  Utilities: Regulatory commission weighs expanding the plan beyond emergencies and throughout the West.   By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR, Times Staff Writer       WASHINGTON--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, responding to pressure from lawmakers, state officials and consumers, is considering a significant expansion of its plan to limit California electricity prices this summer, senior agency officials said Tuesday.      Commissioners and staff members are engaged in intense negotiations in advance of a key meeting Monday to finalize an emergency plan for California and the West.      According to several commission officials, the options being discussed include:      * Extending FERC's current price limits--now in effect only during power emergencies in California--to 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The limits, intended to prevent price spikes, were invoked during two emergencies last month and resulted in immediate cuts in the price of wholesale electricity. FERC is also considering applying such limits throughout the West.      * Requiring power generators in the entire Western region to sell available electricity to California or into their local power grids during emergencies, reducing the threat of blackouts.      * Establishing a regional framework for large power users to sell electricity back into the grid during peak usage times. Some companies that have long-term power contracts at low rates may be able to make money by scaling back their operations and selling electricity.      * Tightening rules on what energy marketers--firms that buy and resell power contracts much like stockbrokers trade shares--can charge for their electricity.      * Expanding an order issued last year that authorized refunds for excessive markups during the most extreme power emergencies. That refund order would now apply to excessive prices during all power emergencies.      The measures under consideration stop short of the price caps being sought by Gov. Gray Davis and California Democrats. But they may go far enough to provide an acceptable compromise.      ""The whole thing is in flux, but it is moving toward a much more effective price mitigation plan, not only for California but for the West,"" said an agency official.      Strong political pressure from Senate Democrats and House Republicans appears to have galvanized FERC into taking a more decisive role. ""We're sort of the last to get it,"" the official said.      FERC has been bitterly criticized by Davis for abandoning California. FERC Chairman Curtis L. Hebert Jr. has responded by citing dozens of modest FERC actions to assist the state.      But Hebert has resisted Davis' central demand that FERC use its legal authority to order a temporary return to fixed electricity rates. Such fixed rates, based on the cost of producing power plus an allowance for profit, were standard before deregulation.      ""The politics of the situation have changed significantly, and commissioners are not immune to politics,"" said another senior agency official. ""The message from Capitol Hill has gotten stronger with a Democratic Senate. Even the Bush administration is saying we should make sure there is no price gouging.""      FERC members have been summoned to testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee chaired by Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) a week from today. Meanwhile, Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), the new Senate Energy Committee chairman, has told FERC he will move legislation to cap electricity rates in the West unless it acts soon.      Agency officials said commissioners do not want to face Lieberman next week empty-handed.      House Republicans have also been prodding the agency. On Tuesday, Energy Committee Chairman W.J. ""Billy"" Tauzin (R-La.) wrote Hebert to urge Western-wide, round-the-clock price limits.      ""We strongly urge the commission to implement a comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor wholesale sales of electric energy . . . within the entire Western Systems Coordinating Council,"" wrote Tauzin, referring to the Western power grid.      FERC officials said a strong effort is underway to achieve a consensus on the five-member commission, lately riven by ideology but now bolstered by two new pragmatic commissioners who favor active oversight of industry.      Commissioner William Massey, who for months has been a lonely dissenter, is continuing to press for the traditional price caps sought by Davis, officials said. Once marginalized, Massey apparently is now being actively wooed by the other members.      S. David Freeman, an energy advisor to Gov. Davis, said Tuesday that expanding FERC's current price limits would be a positive step. But he added that the governor continues to advocate a return to traditional, fixed rates.      ""Any strengthening of the [FERC] plan is in the public interest,"" Freeman told reporters at a Washington news conference.      FERC's price limits are not keyed to a particular dollar amount but are flexible.      When a power emergency is called by the state, FERC's plan limits the price that generators can charge to what it costs to produce power at the least efficient plant running at that time. (The costs of all the plants are determined beforehand by California's grid operator based on data filed by the generators.)      Another requirement of the FERC plan forces generators using the California grid to sell any power they have available during emergency conditions.      When the price limits were tested in two emergencies late last month, prices came down quickly. But power sellers complained that the limits were too strict. And by the second emergency, there was evidence that some sellers had started finding ways around the limits.

Alan Comnes    Wednesday, June 13, 2001   Federal Panel May Extend Price Limits  Utilities: Regulatory commission weighs expanding the plan beyond emergencies and throughout the West.   By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR, Times Staff Writer       WASHINGTON--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, responding to pressure from lawmakers, state officials and consumers, is considering a significant expansion of its plan to limit California electricity prices this summer, senior agency officials said Tuesday.      Commissioners and staff members are engaged in intense negotiations in advance of a key meeting Monday to finalize an emergency plan for California and the West.      According to several commission officials, the options being discussed include:      * Extending FERC's current price limits--now in effect only during power emergencies in California--to 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The limits, intended to prevent price spikes, were invoked during two emergencies last month and resulted in immediate cuts in the price of wholesale electricity. FERC is also considering applying such limits throughout the West.      * Requiring power generators in the entire Western region to sell available electricity to California or into their local power grids during emergencies, reducing the threat of blackouts.      * Establishing a regional framework for large power users to sell electricity back into the grid during peak usage times. Some companies that have long-term power contracts at low rates may be able to make money by scaling back their operations and selling electricity.      * Tightening rules on what energy marketers--firms that buy and resell power contracts much like stockbrokers trade shares--can charge for their electricity.      * Expanding an order issued last year that authorized refunds for excessive markups during the most extreme power emergencies. That refund order would now apply to excessive prices during all power emergencies.      The measures under consideration stop short of the price caps being sought by Gov. Gray Davis and California Democrats. But they may go far enough to provide an acceptable compromise.      ""The whole thing is in flux, but it is moving toward a much more effective price mitigation plan, not only for California but for the West,"" said an agency official.      Strong political pressure from Senate Democrats and House Republicans appears to have galvanized FERC into taking a more decisive role. ""We're sort of the last to get it,"" the official said.      FERC has been bitterly criticized by Davis for abandoning California. FERC Chairman Curtis L. Hebert Jr. has responded by citing dozens of modest FERC actions to assist the state.      But Hebert has resisted Davis' central demand that FERC use its legal authority to order a temporary return to fixed electricity rates. Such fixed rates, based on the cost of producing power plus an allowance for profit, were standard before deregulation.      ""The politics of the situation have changed significantly, and commissioners are not immune to politics,"" said another senior agency official. ""The message from Capitol Hill has gotten stronger with a Democratic Senate. Even the Bush administration is saying we should make sure there is no price gouging.""

Alan Comnes    Wednesday, June 13, 2001   Federal Panel May Extend Price Limits  Utilities: Regulatory commission weighs expanding the plan beyond emergencies and throughout the West.   By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR, Times Staff Writer       WASHINGTON--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, responding to pressure from lawmakers, state officials and consumers, is considering a significant expansion of its plan to limit California electricity prices this summer, senior agency officials said Tuesday.      Commissioners and staff members are engaged in intense negotiations in advance of a key meeting Monday to finalize an emergency plan for California and the West.      According to several commission officials, the options being discussed include:      * Extending FERC's current price limits--now in effect only during power emergencies in California--to 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The limits, intended to prevent price spikes, were invoked during two emergencies last month and resulted in immediate cuts in the price of wholesale electricity. FERC is also considering applying such limits throughout the West.      * Requiring power generators in the entire Western region to sell available electricity to California or into their local power grids during emergencies, reducing the threat of blackouts.      * Establishing a regional framework for large power users to sell electricity back into the grid during peak usage times. Some companies that have long-term power contracts at low rates may be able to make money by scaling back their operations and selling electricity.      * Tightening rules on what energy marketers--firms that buy and resell power contracts much like stockbrokers trade shares--can charge for their electricity.      * Expanding an order issued last year that authorized refunds for excessive markups during the most extreme power emergencies. That refund order would now apply to excessive prices during all power emergencies.      The measures under consideration stop short of the price caps being sought by Gov. Gray Davis and California Democrats. But they may go far enough to provide an acceptable compromise.      ""The whole thing is in flux, but it is moving toward a much more effective price mitigation plan, not only for California but for the West,"" said an agency official.      Strong political pressure from Senate Democrats and House Republicans appears to have galvanized FERC into taking a more decisive role. ""We're sort of the last to get it,"" the official said.      FERC has been bitterly criticized by Davis for abandoning California. FERC Chairman Curtis L. Hebert Jr. has responded by citing dozens of modest FERC actions to assist the state.      But Hebert has resisted Davis' central demand that FERC use its legal authority to order a temporary return to fixed electricity rates. Such fixed rates, based on the cost of producing power plus an allowance for profit, were standard before deregulation.      ""The politics of the situation have changed significantly, and commissioners are not immune to politics,"" said another senior agency official. ""The message from Capitol Hill has gotten stronger with a Democratic Senate. Even the Bush administration is saying we should make sure there is no price gouging.""      FERC members have been summoned to testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee chaired by Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) a week from today. Meanwhile, Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), the new Senate Energy Committee chairman, has told FERC he will move legislation to cap electricity rates in the West unless it acts soon.      Agency officials said commissioners do not want to face Lieberman next week empty-handed.      House Republicans have also been prodding the agency. On Tuesday, Energy Committee Chairman W.J. ""Billy"" Tauzin (R-La.) wrote Hebert to urge Western-wide, round-the-clock price limits.      ""We strongly urge the commission to implement a comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor wholesale sales of electric energy . . . within the entire Western Systems Coordinating Council,"" wrote Tauzin, referring to the Western power grid.      FERC officials said a strong effort is underway to achieve a consensus on the five-member commission, lately riven by ideology but now bolstered by two new pragmatic commissioners who favor active oversight of industry.      Commissioner William Massey, who for months has been a lonely dissenter, is continuing to press for the traditional price caps sought by Davis, officials said. Once marginalized, Massey apparently is now being actively wooed by the other members.      S. David Freeman, an energy advisor to Gov. Davis, said Tuesday that expanding FERC's current price limits would be a positive step. But he added that the governor continues to advocate a return to traditional, fixed rates.

By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR, Times Staff Writer       WASHINGTON--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, responding to pressure from lawmakers, state officials and consumers, is considering a significant expansion of its plan to limit California electricity prices this summer, senior agency officials said Tuesday.      Commissioners and staff members are engaged in intense negotiations in advance of a key meeting Monday to finalize an emergency plan for California and the West.      According to several commission officials, the options being discussed include:      * Extending FERC's current price limits--now in effect only during power emergencies in California--to 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The limits, intended to prevent price spikes, were invoked during two emergencies last month and resulted in immediate cuts in the price of wholesale electricity. FERC is also considering applying such limits throughout the West.      * Requiring power generators in the entire Western region to sell available electricity to California or into their local power grids during emergencies, reducing the threat of blackouts.      * Establishing a regional framework for large power users to sell electricity back into the grid during peak usage times. Some companies that have long-term power contracts at low rates may be able to make money by scaling back their operations and selling electricity.      * Tightening rules on what energy marketers--firms that buy and resell power contracts much like stockbrokers trade shares--can charge for their electricity.      * Expanding an order issued last year that authorized refunds for excessive markups during the most extreme power emergencies. That refund order would now apply to excessive prices during all power emergencies.      The measures under consideration stop short of the price caps being sought by Gov. Gray Davis and California Democrats. But they may go far enough to provide an acceptable compromise.      ""The whole thing is in flux, but it is moving toward a much more effective price mitigation plan, not only for California but for the West,"" said an agency official.      Strong political pressure from Senate Democrats and House Republicans appears to have galvanized FERC into taking a more decisive role. ""We're sort of the last to get it,"" the official said.      FERC has been bitterly criticized by Davis for abandoning California. FERC Chairman Curtis L. Hebert Jr. has responded by citing dozens of modest FERC actions to assist the state.      But Hebert has resisted Davis' central demand that FERC use its legal authority to order a temporary return to fixed electricity rates. Such fixed rates, based on the cost of producing power plus an allowance for profit, were standard before deregulation.      ""The politics of the situation have changed significantly, and commissioners are not immune to politics,"" said another senior agency official. ""The message from Capitol Hill has gotten stronger with a Democratic Senate. Even the Bush administration is saying we should make sure there is no price gouging.""      FERC members have been summoned to testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee chaired by Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) a week from today. Meanwhile, Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), the new Senate Energy Committee chairman, has told FERC he will move legislation to cap electricity rates in the West unless it acts soon.      Agency officials said commissioners do not want to face Lieberman next week empty-handed.      House Republicans have also been prodding the agency. On Tuesday, Energy Committee Chairman W.J. ""Billy"" Tauzin (R-La.) wrote Hebert to urge Western-wide, round-the-clock price limits.      ""We strongly urge the commission to implement a comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor wholesale sales of electric energy . . . within the entire Western Systems Coordinating Council,"" wrote Tauzin, referring to the Western power grid.      FERC officials said a strong effort is underway to achieve a consensus on the five-member commission, lately riven by ideology but now bolstered by two new pragmatic commissioners who favor active oversight of industry.      Commissioner William Massey, who for months has been a lonely dissenter, is continuing to press for the traditional price caps sought by Davis, officials said. Once marginalized, Massey apparently is now being actively wooed by the other members.      S. David Freeman, an energy advisor to Gov. Davis, said Tuesday that expanding FERC's current price limits would be a positive step. But he added that the governor continues to advocate a return to traditional, fixed rates.      ""Any strengthening of the [FERC] plan is in the public interest,"" Freeman told reporters at a Washington news conference.      FERC's price limits are not keyed to a particular dollar amount but are flexible.      When a power emergency is called by the state, FERC's plan limits the price that generators can charge to what it costs to produce power at the least efficient plant running at that time. (The costs of all the plants are determined beforehand by California's grid operator based on data filed by the generators.)      Another requirement of the FERC plan forces generators using the California grid to sell any power they have available during emergency conditions.      When the price limits were tested in two emergencies late last month, prices came down quickly. But power sellers complained that the limits were too strict. And by the second emergency, there was evidence that some sellers had started finding ways around the limits.

""The whole thing is in flux, but it is moving toward a much more effective price mitigation plan, not only for California but for the West,"" said an agency official.      Strong political pressure from Senate Democrats and House Republicans appears to have galvanized FERC into taking a more decisive role. ""We're sort of the last to get it,"" the official said.      FERC has been bitterly criticized by Davis for abandoning California. FERC Chairman Curtis L. Hebert Jr. has responded by citing dozens of modest FERC actions to assist the state.      But Hebert has resisted Davis' central demand that FERC use its legal authority to order a temporary return to fixed electricity rates. Such fixed rates, based on the cost of producing power plus an allowance for profit, were standard before deregulation.      ""The politics of the situation have changed significantly, and commissioners are not immune to politics,"" said another senior agency official. ""The message from Capitol Hill has gotten stronger with a Democratic Senate. Even the Bush administration is saying we should make sure there is no price gouging.""      FERC members have been summoned to testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee chaired by Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) a week from today. Meanwhile, Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), the new Senate Energy Committee chairman, has told FERC he will move legislation to cap electricity rates in the West unless it acts soon.      Agency officials said commissioners do not want to face Lieberman next week empty-handed.      House Republicans have also been prodding the agency. On Tuesday, Energy Committee Chairman W.J. ""Billy"" Tauzin (R-La.) wrote Hebert to urge Western-wide, round-the-clock price limits.      ""We strongly urge the commission to implement a comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor wholesale sales of electric energy . . . within the entire Western Systems Coordinating Council,"" wrote Tauzin, referring to the Western power grid.      FERC officials said a strong effort is underway to achieve a consensus on the five-member commission, lately riven by ideology but now bolstered by two new pragmatic commissioners who favor active oversight of industry.      Commissioner William Massey, who for months has been a lonely dissenter, is continuing to press for the traditional price caps sought by Davis, officials said. Once marginalized, Massey apparently is now being actively wooed by the other members.      S. David Freeman, an energy advisor to Gov. Davis, said Tuesday that expanding FERC's current price limits would be a positive step. But he added that the governor continues to advocate a return to traditional, fixed rates.      ""Any strengthening of the [FERC] plan is in the public interest,"" Freeman told reporters at a Washington news conference.      FERC's price limits are not keyed to a particular dollar amount but are flexible.      When a power emergency is called by the state, FERC's plan limits the price that generators can charge to what it costs to produce power at the least efficient plant running at that time. (The costs of all the plants are determined beforehand by California's grid operator based on data filed by the generators.)      Another requirement of the FERC plan forces generators using the California grid to sell any power they have available during emergency conditions.      When the price limits were tested in two emergencies late last month, prices came down quickly. But power sellers complained that the limits were too strict. And by the second emergency, there was evidence that some sellers had started finding ways around the limits.

Alan Comnes    Wednesday, June 13, 2001   Federal Panel May Extend Price Limits  Utilities: Regulatory commission weighs expanding the plan beyond emergencies and throughout the West.   By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR, Times Staff Writer       WASHINGTON--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, responding to pressure from lawmakers, state officials and consumers, is considering a significant expansion of its plan to limit California electricity prices this summer, senior agency officials said Tuesday.      Commissioners and staff members are engaged in intense negotiations in advance of a key meeting Monday to finalize an emergency plan for California and the West.      According to several commission officials, the options being discussed include:      * Extending FERC's current price limits--now in effect only during power emergencies in California--to 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The limits, intended to prevent price spikes, were invoked during two emergencies last month and resulted in immediate cuts in the price of wholesale electricity. FERC is also considering applying such limits throughout the West.      * Requiring power generators in the entire Western region to sell available electricity to California or into their local power grids during emergencies, reducing the threat of blackouts.      * Establishing a regional framework for large power users to sell electricity back into the grid during peak usage times. Some companies that have long-term power contracts at low rates may be able to make money by scaling back their operations and selling electricity.      * Tightening rules on what energy marketers--firms that buy and resell power contracts much like stockbrokers trade shares--can charge for their electricity.      * Expanding an order issued last year that authorized refunds for excessive markups during the most extreme power emergencies. That refund order would now apply to excessive prices during all power emergencies.      The measures under consideration stop short of the price caps being sought by Gov.

"As you know, now that we are nearly done in capturing the DPR numbers in the  database, we have been working to present the data in compelling ways.  We  have started to do this by creating the VaR Limit Usage graphs and the  Sharpe, Rovar, and Risk - Return graphs.    I am sorry for the misunderstanding with Ted concerning the latter.  I had  explained what I wanted to produce in an e-mail and during a Risk Forum  Luncheon.  Therefore, Shona and I did not expect the reaction we got.  I have  talked to Naveen and Rudi since then, and we have changed the graphs to be  agreeable to RAC.  Today I worked on the graphs below.  They show the P&L decomposition for the  month (rolling 20 business days) up to 9/20 (one in dollar terms and the  other as a percentage of P&L).  I showed them to Shona, and she thought you  should see them before Naveen, Rudi, and Ted, because these graphs are very  powerful and are likely to be controversial.  The graphs show that European  Gas and UK Power released a lot of prudency.  Half of total P&L for European  Gas is prudency, and UK Power would have had a loss of about $20 million  (instead of a gain of $27 million) were it not for prudency.   In the case of  North American Gas, $46 million gain in new deals partly offset about $106  million in trading losses.    Please note that these are rough drafts intended to show what we can do.  I  do not think that there are problems with the data, but I threw these  together today, and I have not yet double-checked the accuracy of my  aggregating calculations.  Please launch the attached spreadsheet, and feel free to call or page me with  questions or concerns.

"In the past few weeks, I have discussed this issue with Brent H., Mark T.  Chris G. and Mary C.  Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includes  Alberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is not  clearly categorized as ""money"" but more likely an ""account"".  Although  certain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including  ""money"", ""intangibles"", which includes ""accounts"", cannot be perfected by  possession.  The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that a  wire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes ""money"".  Although  it is not clear, the better view is that ""money"" means cash in hand and not  on deposit.  The risk is that an unperfected security interest is subordinate  to various parties, including a bankruptcy trustee and to subsequently taken  but properly perfected security interests.  I will admit, however, that this  seems to be a risk that others in our market take (although likely  unknowingly).       Accordingly, to perfect the ""account"" a registration is likely required at  the PPR, which is something we do not want to get into.   Even then, as an ""account"" is an ""intangible"" certain conflicts rules for  perfection by registration need to be considered, as the PPSA jurisdictions  provide that perfection of an intangible is governed by the laws of the  jurisdiction where the debtor is located, as determined by the location of  its principal place of business or chief executive office. i.e.  registration  may be required in some other jurisdiction entirely.  Further, an advance  search would have to be done to see if there are competing prior  registrations.  Also, as the PPR is not a guaranteed title registry,  registration priority does not necessarily guarantee security priority, and  law firms will not typically give priority opinions under the PPSA.    Lastly, if there is an insolvency and the deposit holding institution is also  a creditor of the counterparty, there may be some argument that the deposit  holding institution will assert rights of set off over the account.  In terms of updating advice, the statutory provisions have not to my  knowledge changed.  I suppose there is some possibility that a court has  recently determined that ""money"" includes deposits that we are not aware of,  and I could ask outside counsel to research this issue.

"Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM.    All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

"1.0  John A and Armando.  My question and John's response has led me down the following merry chase:  The LM6000 contract has GE keeping risk of loss and damage until delivery to  the Delivery Point.   The Delivery Point is Jacinto Port.   Without any other  documents, GE has delivered the equipment and Risk of Loss and Damage is  Brazilian Trust's.   I understand that some deal was cut in a letter that Ben  Jacoby sent to GE where GE keeps the ROL while in storage, but there are some  storage costs.  (Note:) We have a very painful experience on a turbine from another vendor  where the point and time of transfer of risk of loss is a central issue to a  dispute at hand.)   I think we need clear documentation making it clear that GE has ROL for the  equipment until we take it out of storage.  As it relates to NEPCO if I understand it correctly the risk of loss chain is  as follows: GE delivers to the Jacinto port where Risk of loss transfers to  Brazilian Trust,  Brazilian Trust delivers to the port  and keeps risk of  loss until Ex Terra, at which point risk of loss under the Turbine Purchase  Agreement transfers to NEPCO, but under the EPC contract SFE assumes risk of  loss at ExTerra.  Thus NEPCO does not have a risk of loss exposure.    I can see how NEPCO transports from Exterra to the Site under the EPC  contract and is protected by clause 8.1 of the EPC Contract.    Under what authority is NEPCO transporting the equipment from the GE  delivery point to Exterra, has Brazilian Trust engaged NEPCO to do so?  The  Turbine Purchase Agreement does not contemplate this.  2.0  David Gohlke-  I think we have a small hole that needs and can be easily  filled.  In the Turbine Purchase Agreement, can we have NEPCO perform  transport service from the GE delivery point to Exterra but BT keeps ROL.  3.0 I think from a GE perspective,  the Enron family takes ROL from GE at  Jacinto port and gets the turbines delivered to  the Site.    4.0  Kay Mann - I really need a copy of the Ben letter- we start moving  equipment shortly- I need to make sure that the ROL issue with GE is  adequately covered.",8 May,john.rigby@enron.com,test/mann-k_notes_inbox_605.txt.ann,MANN-K,10:40:00,john.ayres@enron.com

"NETWORK WORLD NEWSLETTER: PHIL HOCHMUTH on LINUX 04/16/01 - Today's focus: Super-secret Linux  Dear Wincenty Kaminski,  In this issue:  * National Security Agency is bulletproofing the operating system * Links related to Linux * Featured reader resource * CAREER CORNER: Mission-critical opportunities with marketplace                  winners  _______________________________________________________________ If a friend has forwarded this newsletter to you, why not sign-up for your own free copy? Visit http://www.nwwsubscribe.com/FOC162 for your own free subscription. _______________________________________________________________ Today's focus: Super-secret Linux  By Phil Hochmuth  Network Associates is teaming up with the National Security Agency, the government's top electronic cryptography and spying institution, to help the agency fine-tune its highly secure version of Linux. The goal is to create a version of Linux that is impervious to outside attacks.  Security Enhanced Linux, or SELinux, is a project under development by the NSA to create a version of the operating system that is more secure than the commercial distributions of Linux available from software vendors and the open-source community. The PGP Security division of Network Associates is working with the NSA to modify the Linux source code so that applications running on a Linux server or PC have reduced access to a Linux machine's underlying operating system. The aim is to give Linux servers the ability to shirk off ""buffer overrun"" and ""format string"" attacks, which take advantage of loose ends in Linux applications to access a server's core operating system and shut it down. A Linux worm dubbed ""Lion"" was recently identified as using this method to hack Linux servers.  NSA has worked with other software firms to shore up other weaknesses in the operating system. Secure Computing has worked on the SELinux project to add its Type Enforcement technology to SELinux. Type Enforcement protects the operating system and applications by segmenting them into security ""domains"" with specifications on what types of files can be accessed by each domain. (For example, this could be used to prevent access to a configuration file through an application, such as Apache Web server). NSA is also working with VMWare to come up with a more secure user permissions system for allowing users with different security access to work on the same server.  The good news for Linux users who are not high-level NSA operatives is that SELinux will be released to the open-source community once finished. This means that commercial Linux vendors could include SELinux security enhancements in future releases, resulting in more bulletproof Linux Web and database servers in enterprises.  _______________________________________________________________ To contact Phil Hochmuth:  Phil Hochmuth is a staff writer for Network World, and a former systems integrator.

EBS ""Go-Live""  On April 1st, Enron Broadband Services supplemented their current SAP  functionality with HR Online and SAP HR, including payroll and organizational  structure management.  HR Online enables the EBS population to enter their  own time, view and update their personal information, and view their vacation  time and individual payroll information via Enron's intranet.  Additionally, this implementation enhanced the SAP Financial, Project and  Procurement processes that EBS has had in operation since April 1, 1999.   These enhancements included an EBS pilot of B2B, a web-based requisitioning  tool. Among the benefits of these enhancements will be improved information  flow across business units currently on SAP.  July 1 ""Go-Live""  This final Apollo and Beyond implementation will directly impact more than  15,000 Enron employees and contractors -- odds are that you are one of them!   People impacted on July 1st include:  all Enron employees paid out of Corporate Payroll in Houston, excluding  Azurix employees the financial communities of Enron Energy Services, Enron Investment  Partners, Enron North America, Enron Renewable Energy Corporation, Gas  Pipeline Group, Global Finance, and Global Products. the project management communities of Enron North America, Gas Pipeline  Group, Global Asset Operations, Global Finance, and Global Products. the human resources communities of Corporate, Global E&P, Enron Energy  Services, Enron Engineering and Construction Company, Enron Investment  Partners, Enron North America, Enron Renewable Energy Corporation (Houston  only), the international regions, Gas Pipeline Group, Global Finance, and  Global Products.  General SAP training will be available in late April via the Enron intranet.   Additional, specific, SAP classes and workshops are scheduled to begin in May  and continue through August.  Information on the project can be obtained  through the Enron intranet at http://sap.enron.com and by contacting Business  Unit representatives currently working with the project.  A list of Business  Unit representatives is located on the intranet site.  Additional information related to the July 1st implementation will be  communicated to you over the next few months.

He hopes to accomplish more in a larger group where he can have more interaction with his peers who have similar backgrounds. I think also that he developed an appreciation for good interpersonal  relations in my group he could observe during his stay in Houston.

"Mr. Fastow,  I'm writing all of our participants and confirming plans for the upcoming corporate finance meetings on May 4-5 here.  As a reminder, you are slated to sit on the executive option/equity dilution panel on Saturday morning.  Dave Yermack from NYU, the number one expert on this issue, is presenting at that session.  (Again, serving as a panelist should require little preparation on your behalf.)  Also, you and your wife are welcome to attend the dinner on Friday evening, May 4.  It will be held in the Baker Institute across from the business school.  Tom Copeland is our speaker - (I think he plans to focus his remarks on real options).  Vince Kaminski  has told me he will be at the dinner, however his wife is out of town and will not be.  Please call me direct if I can be of any help or assistance.   I look forward to seeing you soon.  I've attached a copy of the program along with a name rooster of those planning to attend.

"Dr. Kaminski:  I am a Ph.D. student here at Carnegie Mellon who has a long-standing interest in the energy industry.  I have recently developed the framework of a simple model for electricity prices that I would like your opinion on. Could you please chalk out some time for me during your CMU visit this Friday?  Unlike traditional electricty pricing models, which assume that the log-price is a sum of a couple of stochastic factors, I assume that some fundamentals of the electricity market are driven by stochastic factors. Next, given the current values of these factors, price is determined by economic forces of profit maximization by price setting electricity generators. Unlike typical factor models, the factors in my model are potentially observable.   Thank You,     Aziz A.

"My only warning is that working for Sheila is that she takes over most of the  big stuff, even if it is your deal. Everything that she is working on now was  one of her lawyers' deals, but ""things just weren't getting done"".  She can  be very unclear in what she expects from you.  She is the ultimate  micro-manager.  She may hire the outside counsel on ""your"" deal, then tell  you about it later, not consulting you to find out who you want to use.    This style may not bother you, as you may in fact get comfort from working  closely with someone.  Clearly, she has a lot of experience to impart, and  she is very, very nice.

"John Schultes is quite smart and very precise in his use of language.? Even  though he speaks with an accent, he is easy to understand and he is very  careful with his words.? I thought he acquitted himself reasonably well under  difficult conditions.? However, Schultes' natural demeanor is somewhat formal  and aloof; I don't think a jury is going to like him.? At best they'll be  neutral; they won't warm up to him.   Schultes has sued McDonald and SDI in Cleveland, Ohio--apparently some sort  of defamation and wrongful termination.? I am getting the complaint, will  have it sent to you.? Schultes was deposed for three days a few weeks ago in  that case.? We will try to get the transcript.  Schultes is unemployed.? His defense is being paid for by AIG under a D&O  policy.   Kathy spent a lot of time on Schultes' response in 9/98 to Bob Walters 8/98  memo.? In his response Schultes acknowledged a number of shortcomings at NSM  but took the position that everyone knew all about them at the time of the  offering.  KPMG wrote management letters in connection with NSM financial statements for  the year ended 12/31/96 and the quarters ended 3/31/97 and 6/30/97--probably  for later periods as well, like 12/31/97.? KPMG has produced documents.? We  are getting them this week.? E&Y also did a special report for McDonald in  the second half of 1997; McDonald has produced a copy.? E&Y is still fighting  about producing its documents.? Schultes says he never saw the E&Y report.  Enron came up twice today, not with much emphasis--both times dealing with  events after the closing.? A memo of Brian's dated 7/28/98 relating to a  Management Company meeting was discussed briefly.? The report or review that  the Enron team prepared in August 1998 was discussed at a little more  length.? Nothing harmful.? To date there has been virtually no testimony  about any role of Enron or ECT in the underwriting process--just about all  testimony has been about post-closing events.  Kathy also pressed Schultes to admit that NSM's actual production of steel  before the offering was quite limited.? Schultes quarreled with her a bit on  this.

Weather may provide some short-lived price spikes in February, but until real evidence of the anticipated decline in US supply appears, prices will feel continued downward pressure from record-high storage inventories. The projected February average price is $2.10 per MMBtu at the Henry Hub.  * March storage inventories will end at record high levels. Ample gas remains to keep prices low until a rebounding economy and declining supplies can provide a lift.  * With return to a normal weather, strong industrial loads will boost overall gas demand slightly over last year's levels.  * Diminishing weather-related support and high western storage inventories will drive widening discounts to the Henry Hub in the western producing areas, while weak demand and high storage will limit premiums in the East.  **end**  Follow above ULR for complete CERA Monthly Briefing (7 printed pages).

"July 25, 2001   SBSC RELEASES 40 PAGE GUIDE TO U.S. ENERGY POLICY HISTORY & POLICY OPTIONS  Washington, D.C.-The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) has just issued a 40 page guide to a successful U.S. energy policy.  The new SBSC report provides a wealth of energy facts; a history of U.S. energy policy; a sober assessment of global warming and related proposed policies; a look at what has gone wrong in states like California; and an assessment of the Bush administration's energy proposals.   ""Our energy crisis today is not about a looming depletion of energy resources, threatened destruction of the environment, wasteful consumers, greedy energy companies, or even OPEC.  Instead, we are experiencing a crisis of misguided government rules, regulations, and taxes that have endangered consumers, businesses of every size and type, U.S. competitiveness, and the economy,"" said SBSC chief economist Raymond J. Keating, author of the SBSC report entitled ""Energy Freedom: Lifting Government Burdens on U.S. Energy Producers & Consumers.""  ""Nothing is more crucial to the future of the economy and survival of small businesses than a successful energy policy,"" said SBSC president Darrell McKigney.  ""Our goal in this report is to show that providing relief from regulatory restrictions and red tape, expanding energy exploration and development, and reducing international trade barriers are the real keys to successful energy plan.""  The complete 40 page ""Energy Freedom: Lifting Government Burdens on U.S. Energy Producers & Consumers"" is the latest report in SBSC's ""21st Century Small Business Policy Series,"" and can be downloaded from the group's website at www.sbsc.org,  or you can request a printed copy by calling Priscilla Tacujan at (202) 785-0238.  Author Ray Keating is available for interviews, as is SBSC President Darrell McKigney.  SBSC is a leading national nonprofit, nonpartisan small business advocacy group headquartered in Washington, D.C.

I gather that ""Exotic Options"" is the one you intend to use in your class, correct?  By the way, I queried participants in my class, and I heard that the case study approach we occaisionally used was appreciated by several.  The VAR class I taught was from Jorian's book, which has no exercises and which assumes a particular background in finance and statistics.  I created a problem (not exactly a case study) that required participant to learn some statistics and try some different approaches.  From this, participants got a better idea of why one bothers with certain issues.  Some liked the ""real world"" flavor of this kind of approach.

"On Tues. 9/21 I met with Phil Zirngibl, the Alliance manager for Ft. James.   I informed him Enron wanted the original $10mm back.  It was our belief that   FJ did not act in good faith in ""expeditiously and fairly evaluating"" all of  Enron's energy proposals.  Phil argued that Enron saw substantial revenue  from the commodity (gas & coal) deals that were executed.  I argued that  commodity deals were never the ""intent"" of the Alliance as outlined in the  ""Objectives of the Parties.""  I told him we didn't need an Alliance agreement  to do commodity deals.  Phil was only prepared to argue the definition of ""substantial assets"" as it  related to the asset sale.  I told him Kalamazoo was substantial to us  because that was where we had a significant energy project.  It was also  substantial because the mill was ranked in the top 3 in terms of natural gas  consumption.  FJ let us work on the Kzoo project for 9 months before  informing us the mill would be sold.  I told Phil this is not how Alliance  partners treat each other.  I asked Phil if he was prepared to offer any proposal to resolve the  situation.  His response was FJ was happy with the Alliance and wanted to  continue with it ""as is.""  My response was that was not acceptable to Enron.  I told him the list of potential mediators for the dispute was being sent to  their counsel Greg Chaffee.  Next Steps:  I think we need to pick out a couple of strong project examples to use in our  case to present to the mediator.  Rather than just show the list of potential  deals Enron pitched and the lost opportunity value, I think a stronger case  to get our original $10mm back is to say here are 3 examples, here is the  value to both parties, and FJ still did not do the project (or they chose to  do it themselves).  This should go a long way to proving ""bad faith"".    I will get with David Barr and start assembling this information along with  the entire project list and the various ""reasons"" FJ chose not to do the  projects.  Based on this initial meeting, if the parties can't resolve the dispute  within 30 days, the dispute goes to non-binding mediation.

"Gregg:  Here is a very brief summary of my review of the LLC Agreement.  It appears  that the only thing we really need in order for Enron to more actively manage  enovate's funds is a resolution by enovate's Board of Managers approving  Enron Corp.'s investment of enovate's funds according to a policy that  mirror's Enron's investment policy.  This would enable our treasury group to  invest enovate's funds in the same manner that they invest Enron's.  I  believe the following provisions of the LLC Agreement already contemplate  such an arrangement:    enovate is managed by the Board of Managers, which delegates its management  rights to the Managing Member (which is an Enron entity) (Section 6.1). The Board adopts various policies and guidelines for certain activities of  enovate, and enovate has apparently already adopted Enron Corp.'s risk  procedures and control guidelines (see def'n of Risk Procedures and Control  Guidelines).  The mechanism is already in place for enovate to adopt Enron's  investment policies. The Managing Member has the express authority under Section 6.1.2, subject to  the risk guidelines, to (among other things) open and maintain bank and  investment accounts (Section 6.1.2(c) and invest Company funds in the name  and on behalf of the Company (Section 6.1.2(j)).  The Managing Member is also  required to establish and maintain certain accounts for the Company (Section  10.4).   The Managing Member has the obligation to provide reports to the Board of  Managers, which will enable the Board of Managers to ensure that Enron is  complying with the investment policy. The LLC agreement does prohibit the Managing Member from commingling  enovate's funds with those of any other member.  Our treasury group has  confirmed that any investment of enovate's funds by Enron will be as agent  for enovate and investments will be held in enovate's name. Enron's treasury group already provides a similar function to several other  entities with third party investors in which we are the managing member.  I  am certain that they would be happy to answer any questions that Peoples may  have about how the investment program would be implemented and conducted.  Therefore, I think that the LLC agreement already provides the basic  authorization for Enron to invest enovate's funds; in fact, Enron could  really just go ahead and start an investment program without any action by  the members whatsoever -- adopting an investment policy and investing funds  is clearly within the authority already granted to the Managing Member.    Obviously, though, it is in our best interests to make sure that Peoples is  comfortable with what we are doing,  We could probably also ""customize"" the  resolutions authorizing Enron to provide this service to address any concerns  that Peoples may have; however, I think it would be best if we did not  substantially depart from the existing Enron guidelines, as it may make it  more difficult for the treasury group to manage the funds if they are  required to operate by different rules.  Feel free to pass this message on to Peoples, and feel free to call if you  have any questions before our Thursday call.

The Managing Member has the express authority under Section 6.1.2, subject to  the risk guidelines, to (among other things) open and maintain bank and  investment accounts (Section 6.1.2(c) and invest Company funds in the name  and on behalf of the Company (Section 6.1.2(j)).  The Managing Member is also  required to establish and maintain certain accounts for the Company (Section  10.4).   The Managing Member has the obligation to provide reports to the Board of  Managers, which will enable the Board of Managers to ensure that Enron is  complying with the investment policy. The LLC agreement does prohibit the Managing Member from commingling  enovate's funds with those of any other member.  Our treasury group has  confirmed that any investment of enovate's funds by Enron will be as agent  for enovate and investments will be held in enovate's name. Enron's treasury group already provides a similar function to several other  entities with third party investors in which we are the managing member.  I  am certain that they would be happy to answer any questions that Peoples may  have about how the investment program would be implemented and conducted.  Therefore, I think that the LLC agreement already provides the basic  authorization for Enron to invest enovate's funds; in fact, Enron could  really just go ahead and start an investment program without any action by  the members whatsoever -- adopting an investment policy and investing funds  is clearly within the authority already granted to the Managing Member.    Obviously, though, it is in our best interests to make sure that Peoples is  comfortable with what we are doing,  We could probably also ""customize"" the  resolutions authorizing Enron to provide this service to address any concerns  that Peoples may have; however, I think it would be best if we did not  substantially depart from the existing Enron guidelines, as it may make it  more difficult for the treasury group to manage the funds if they are  required to operate by different rules.  Feel free to pass this message on to Peoples, and feel free to call if you  have any questions before our Thursday call.

"November 26, 2001  As indicated by the Critical System Warning issued November 25, 2001, based on anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated below, TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) is requiring that all customers take immediate and prompt steps to eliminate excess receipts and conform scheduled receipts to actual deliveries. This system-wide warning is issued as a result of actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual deliveries. This Critical System Warning shall remain in place until further notice.  Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is virtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual imbalances left on the system.  Because of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be accepted into the system until further notice.  If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an operational flow order (""OFO"") requiring actual receipts of gas to match actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition and as provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.       *******************************************************************  NOTE:  Duke Energy Gas Transmission respects your online time and privacy.
